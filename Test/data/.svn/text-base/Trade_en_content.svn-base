'''Trade''' is the transfer of [[ownership]] of goods   and services from one person or entity to another by getting something in exchange from the [[buyer]]. Trade is sometimes loosely called [[commerce]] or [[financial transaction]] or barter. A network that allows trade is called a [[market]].  The original form of trade was [[barter (economics)|barter]], the direct exchange of goods and services.  Later one side of the barter were the metals, precious metals (poles{{Clarify|date=October 2012|Poles? What is a pole?}}, coins), bill, paper money. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as [[money]]. As a result, '''buying''' can be separated from '''selling''', or [[Earnings|earning]]. The invention of money (and later credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.

Trade exists for man due to specialization and division of labor, in which most people concentrate on a small aspect of production, trading for other products.  Trade exists between regions because different regions have a [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable [[commodity]], or because different regions size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]]. As such, trade at [[market price]]s between locations benefits both locations.

[[Retail]] trade consists of the [[sales|sale]] of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location, such as a [[department store]], [[boutique]] or [[kiosk]], or by [[mail]], in small or individual lots for direct [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] by the purchaser.&lt;ref name="fas">{{cite web|date=2000-02-09|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/factsheets/China/distribution.html|title=Distribution Services|publisher=[[Foreign Agricultural Service]]|accessdate=2006-04-04}}&lt;/ref> [[Wholesale]] trade is defined as the sale of goods or [[merchandise]] to [[retailer]]s, to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional [[business]] users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.&lt;ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/completeacc_e.htm#chn WTO – World Trade Organization]&lt;/ref>

Trading can also refer to the action performed by [[trader (finance)|traders]] and other market agents in the [[financial markets]].

===Prehistory===
Trade originated with the [[history of communication|start of communication]] in [[prehistoric]] times. Trading was the main facility of prehistoric people, who bartered goods and services from each other before the innovation of the modern day currency. [[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] dates the [[History of international trade|history of long-distance commerce]] from [[circa]] 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Watson2005_150">[[#Watson2005|Watson (2005)]], Introduction.&lt;/ref>

For instance, [[Radhanite]]s were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of [[Jew]]ish merchants who traded between the [[Christian]]s in [[Europe]] and the [[Muslim]]s of the [[Near East]].

Archaeological evidence (Greenberg 1951) of the first use of trade-marks are from China dated about 2700 BC.&lt;ref>AS Greenberg - J. Pat. Off. Soc'y, 1951 - HeinOnline&lt;/ref>

==== Central America ====

The emergence of exchange networks in the primitive societies of and near to Mexico are known to have occurred within recent years before and after 1500 BC.&lt;ref>K G Hirth - [http://www.jstor.org/stable/279629 American Antiquity Vol. 43, No. 1 (Jan., 1978), pp. 35-45] Retrieved 2012-06-28&lt;/ref>

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world.&lt;ref name="Beckwith2011_xxiv">[[#Beckwith2011|Beckwith (2011)]], p.&amp;nbsp;xxiv.&lt;/ref> The [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]]s dominated the East-West trade route known as the [[Silk Road]] after the 4th century AD up to the 8th century AD, with [[Suyab]] and [[Taraz|Talas]] ranking among their main centers in the north. They were the main [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] merchants of [[Central Asia]].

From the 8th to the 11th century, the [[Viking]]s and [[Varangians]] traded as they sailed from and to [[Scandinavia]].  Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to [[Russia]].  The [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over most of [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], between the 13th and 17th centuries.

===Age of Discovery===
[[Vasco da Gama]] pioneered the European [[Spice trade]] in 1498 when he reached [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] after sailing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the [[Age of Discovery]] in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling [[gold]].

In the 16th century, the [[Seventeen Provinces]] were the centre of free trade, imposing no [[exchange control]]s, and advocating the free movement of goods.  Trade in the [[East Indies]] was dominated by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century, [[Holland]] in the 17th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 18th century. The [[Spanish Empire]] developed regular trade links across both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans.

In 1776, [[Adam Smith]] published the paper ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. It criticised [[Mercantilism]], and argued that [[economic]] [[Specialization (functional)|specialisation]] could benefit nations just as much as firms.  Since the [[division of labour]] was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more [[productive]]. Smith said that he considered all rationalisations of [[International trade|import]] and [[export]] controls "dupery", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.

In 1799, the [[Dutch East India Company]], formerly the world's largest company, became [[bankrupt]], partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.

===Age of Reason===
In 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:
: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''

The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.

[[John Stuart Mill]] proved that a country with monopoly [[pricing power]] on the international market could manipulate the [[terms of trade]] through maintaining [[tariff]]s, and that the response to this might be [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in trade policy.  Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier.  This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the [[economic surplus]] of trade would accrue to a country following ''reciprocal'', rather than completely free, trade policies.  This was followed within a few years by the [[infant industry]] scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that government had the "duty" to [[protectionism|protect]] young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to [[industrialize|industrialise]] and out-compete [[England|English]] exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.&lt;ref>Price theory Milton Friedman&lt;/ref>

===20th century===
The [[Great Depression]] was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s.  During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.

The lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Only during the [[World War II]] the recession ended in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions.  It set up rules and institutions to regulate the [[international political economy]]: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements).  These organisations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement.  In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] to promote free trade.

During the early years of the Cold-war, the United States of America and the then Soviet USSR were engaged in talks to exchange two captured military personnel, a "trade"  carried out during 1962 (Polmar p.&amp;nbsp;142).&lt;ref>N Polmar - ''Spyplane: The U-2 History Declassified'' Zenith Imprint, 14 Apr 2001 ISBN 0760309574 Retrieved 2012-06-28&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>(secondary) M Smith - [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lf2VQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=China+Hidden+Cloak+and+Dagger+History+of+MI5&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z6DsT-yYE8LO8QOSkqXCBQ&amp;redir_esc=y V.

===Free trade===
{{main|Free trade}}
Free trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s:
* 1992 [[European Union]] lifted barriers to internal trade in [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]].
* January 1, 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) took effect
* 1994 The GATT [[Marrakech Agreement]] specified formation of the WTO.
* January 1, 1995 [[World Trade Organization]] was created to facilitate [[free trade]], by mandating mutual [[most favoured nation]] trading status between all signatories.
* EC was transformed into the European Union, which accomplished the Economic and Monnetary Union (EMU) in 2002, through introducing the Euro, and creating this way a real single market between 13 member states as of January 1, 2007.
* 2005, the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] was signed; It includes the United States and the Dominican Republic.

===Protectionism===
{{main|Protectionism}}
Protectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade.  This policy often takes of form of [[tariffs]] and restrictive [[Import quota|quotas]].  Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the [[great depression]] and the onset of World War II.

===Religion===
Muslim teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest). By trade the whole society get benefits but interest makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.&lt;ref>[[#Nomani1994|Nomani &amp; Rahnema (1994)]], p.&amp;nbsp;?. "I want nine out of ten people from my Ummah (nation) as traders" and "Trader, who did trading in truth, and sold the right quantity and quality of goods, he will stand along Prophets and Martyrs, on Judgment day".&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities; but let there be among you traffic and trade by mutual good-will." {{cite quran|4|29|style=ref}} and "Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury." {{cite quran|2|275|style=ref}}&lt;/ref>

[[Judeo-Christian]] teachings encourage traders to avoid dishonest gain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Development of money===
{{Main|History of money}}
[[Image:SNGCop 039.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Athens|Ancient Athenian Greek]] [[Drachma]] coin]]
[[Image:Maximinus denarius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[denarius]]]]
The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called [[commodity money]] and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval [[Iraq]], bread was used as an early form of money.  In [[Mexico]] under [[Montezuma]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} cocoa beans were money.  [http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm]

[[Currency]] was introduced as a standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services.  This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.

[[Numismatist]]s have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].&lt;ref name="originsofmoney">Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in [[#Davies2002|Davies (2002)]].&lt;/ref>

Ancient Sparta minted [[coins]] from iron to discourage its citizens from engaging in foreign trade.

==Current trends==
===Doha rounds===
{{Main|Doha round}}

The Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aims to lower [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] around the world, with a focus on making [[fair trade|trade fairer]] for [[developing countries]].  Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich [[developed countries]], represented by the [[G20]], and the major developing countries.  [[Agricultural subsidies]] are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on [[trade facilitation]] and capacity building.

The Doha round began in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], and negotiations have subsequently continued in: [[Cancún]], Mexico; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; and [[Paris]], [[France]] and Hong Kong.

===China===
Beginning around 1978, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) began an experiment in [[economic reforms in China|economic reform]]. In contrast to the previous [[USSR|Soviet]]-style [[centrally planned economy]], the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, that led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) [[Special Economic Zone]]s located along the South-east coast.

The reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, [[price]] and [[demand]]. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.

In 1991 the PRC joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization.

==International trade==
{{Main|International trade}}
{{Trade bloc}}

International trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders.  In most countries, it represents a significant part of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, [[Amber Road]]), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of [[Industrialization]], advanced transportation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]]. In fact, it is probably the increasing prevalence of international trade that is usually meant by the term "globalization".

Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as [[South Korea]], which adopted a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]], and India, which historically had a more closed policy (although it has begun to open its economy, as of 2005).  South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.

===Trade sanctions===
[[Trade sanctions]] against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action.  An [[embargo]], a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] against [[Cuba]] for over 40 years.

===Trade barriers===
Although there are usually few trade restrictions within countries, international trade is usually regulated by governmental quotas and restrictions, and often taxed by tariffs.  Tariffs are usually on imports, but sometimes countries may impose export tariffs or [[subsidy|subsidies]].  All of these are called '''[[trade barriers]]'''.  If a government removes all trade barriers, a condition of free trade exists.  A government that implements a protectionist policy establishes trade barriers.

===Fair trade===
The '''[[fair trade]]''' movement, also known as the '''trade justice''' movement, promotes the use of [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Social issues|social]] standards for the production of [[commodities]], particularly those exported from the [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]]s to the [[First World]]. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a [[human right]].&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Should trade be considered a human right?|date=9 December 2008|publisher=COPLA|url=http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523}}&lt;/ref>

Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of [[employment law|employment]] and [[commercial law]].  Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of [[good (economics)|goods]] made using [[slave labour]] to minimum [[price support]] schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.  [[Non-governmental organization]]s also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with [[fair trade labeling]] requirements.
