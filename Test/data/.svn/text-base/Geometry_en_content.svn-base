{{General geometry}}
'''Geometry''' ({{lang-grc|''Î³ÎµÏ‰Î¼ÎµÏ„Ï?Î¯Î±''}}; ''[[wikt:Î³á¿†|geo-]]'' "earth", ''[[wikt:Î¼Î­Ï„Ï?Î¿Î½|-metron]]'' "measurement") is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.  Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a body of practical knowledge concerning [[length]]s, [[area]]s, and [[volume]]s, with elements of a formal mathematical science emerging in the West as early as [[Thales]] (6th Century BC).  By the 3rd century BC geometry was put into an [[axiomatic system|axiomatic form]] by [[Euclid]], whose treatmentâ€”[[Euclidean geometry]]â€”set a standard for many centuries to follow.&lt;ref>Martin J. Turner,Jonathan M. Blackledge,Patrick R. Andrews (1998). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=oLXgFdfKp78C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Fractal geometry in digital imaging]''". [[Academic Press]]. p.1. ISBN 0-12-703970-8&lt;/ref> [[Archimedes]] developed ingenious techniques for calculating areas and volumes, in many ways anticipating modern [[integral calculus]].  The field of [[astronomy]], especially mapping the positions of the [[star]]s and [[planet]]s on the [[celestial sphere]] and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, served as an important source of geometric problems during the next one and a half millennia.  Both geometry and astronomy were considered in the classical world to be part of the [[Quadrivium]], a subset of the seven [[liberal arts#History|liberal arts]] considered essential for a free citizen to master.

The introduction of [[coordinates]] by [[RenÃ© Descartes]] and the concurrent developments of [[algebra]] marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures, such as [[plane curve]]s, could now be represented [[analytic geometry|analytically]], i.e., with functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in the 17th century. Furthermore, the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of [[projective geometry]]. The subject of geometry was further enriched by the study of intrinsic structure of geometric objects that originated with [[Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and led to the creation of [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]].

In Euclid's time there was no clear distinction between physical space and geometrical space. Since the 19th-century discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the concept of [[space]] has undergone a radical transformation, and the question arose: which geometrical space best fits physical space?
With the rise of formal mathematics in the 20th century, also 'space' (and 'point', 'line', 'plane') lost its intuitive contents, so today we have to distinguish between physical space, geometrical spaces (in which 'space', 'point' etc. still have their intuitive meaning) and abstract spaces.
Contemporary geometry considers [[manifold]]s, spaces that are considerably more abstract than the familiar [[Euclidean space]], which they only approximately resemble at small scales. These spaces may be endowed with additional structure, allowing one to speak about length. Modern geometry has multiple strong bonds with [[physics]], exemplified by the ties between [[pseudo-Riemannian]] geometry and [[general relativity]]. One of the youngest physical theories, [[string theory]], is also very geometric in flavour.

While the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than other parts of mathematics, such as algebra or [[number theory]], geometric language is also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance (for example, in [[fractal geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]).&lt;ref>It is quite common in algebraic geometry to speak about ''geometry of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s'', possibly [[singularity theory|singular]]. From a naÃ¯ve perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by invoking powerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric techniques, it is possible to find structure and establish properties that make them somewhat analogous to the ordinary [[sphere]]s or [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]s.&lt;/ref>

==Overview==
[[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Visual [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for the (3, 4, 5) [[triangle]] as in the [[Chou Pei Suan Ching]] 500â€“200&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

The recorded development of geometry spans more than two [[millennia]]. It is hardly surprising that perceptions of what constituted geometry evolved throughout the ages.

===Practical geometry===
Geometry originated as a practical science concerned with surveying, measurements, areas, and volumes. Among the notable accomplishments one finds formulas for  [[length]]s, [[area]]s and [[volume]]s, such as [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[circumference]] and [[area of a disk|area]] of a circle, area of a [[triangle]], volume of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], and a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]. A method of computing certain inaccessible distances or heights based on [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] of geometric figures is attributed to [[Thales]]. Development of [[astronomy]] led to emergence of [[trigonometry]] and [[spherical trigonometry]], together with the attendant computational techniques.

===Axiomatic geometry===
[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of Euclid's [[parallel postulate]]]]
{{See also|Euclidean geometry}}
[[Euclid]] took a more abstract approach in his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain [[axiom]]s, or [[postulate]]s, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as ''axiomatic'' or ''[[synthetic geometry|synthetic]]'' geometry. At the start of the 19th century the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Gauss]], [[Lobachevsky]], [[Bolyai]], and others led to a revival of interest, and in the 20th century [[David Hilbert]] employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.

===Geometric constructions===
{{Main|Compass and straightedge constructions}}
Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[ruler|straightedge]]. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.

===Numbers in geometry===
[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a  triangle could have [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lengths.]]
In [[ancient Greece]] the [[Pythagoreans]] considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths, which contradicted their philosophical views, made them abandon abstract numbers in favor of concrete geometric quantities, such as length and area of figures. Numbers were reintroduced into geometry in the form of [[coordinate]]s by [[Descartes]], who realized that the study of geometric shapes can be facilitated by their algebraic representation, and whom the [[Cartesian plane]] is named after. [[Analytic geometry]] applies methods of algebra to geometric questions, typically by relating geometric [[curve]]s and algebraic [[equation]]s. These ideas played a key role in the development of [[calculus]] in the 17th century and led to discovery of many new properties of plane curves. Modern [[algebraic geometry]] considers similar questions on a vastly more abstract level.

===Geometry of position===
{{Main|Projective geometry|Topology}}
Even in ancient times, geometers considered questions of relative position or spatial relationship of geometric figures and shapes. Some examples are given by inscribed and circumscribed circles of [[polygon]]s, lines intersecting and tangent to [[conic section]]s, the [[Pappus configuration|Pappus]] and [[Menelaus theorem|Menelaus]] configurations of points and lines. In the Middle Ages new and more complicated questions of this type were considered: What is the maximum number of spheres simultaneously touching a given sphere of the same radius ([[kissing number problem]])? What is the densest [[sphere packing|packing of spheres]] of equal size in space ([[Kepler conjecture]])? Most of these questions involved 'rigid' geometrical shapes, such as lines or spheres. [[Projective geometry|Projective]], [[Convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] are three sub-disciplines within present day geometry that deal with these and related questions.

[[Leonhard Euler]], in studying problems like the [[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg]], considered the most fundamental properties of geometric figures based solely on shape, independent of their metric properties. Euler called this new branch of geometry ''geometria situs'' (geometry of place), but it is now known as [[topology]]. Topology grew out of geometry, but turned into a large independent discipline. It does not differentiate between objects that can be continuously deformed into each other. The objects may nevertheless retain some geometry, as in the case of [[hyperbolic knot]]s.

===Geometry beyond Euclid===
[[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|right|[[Differential geometry]] uses tools from [[calculus]] to study problems in geometry.]]
For nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, basic understanding of [[space]] remained essentially the same. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that there is only one, ''absolute'', geometry, which is known to be true ''a priori'' by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was [[synthetic a priori]].&lt;ref>Kline (1972) "Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times", Oxford University Press, p. 1032.  Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) ''possibility'' of non-Euclidean geometry, see [[Jeremy Gray]], "Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact ''predicted'' the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, "Philosophy and Axiomatics," Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy, Dover, 1965; p.164.&lt;/ref>  This dominant view was overturned by the revolutionary discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the works of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (who never published his theory), [[Bolyai]], and [[Lobachevsky]], who demonstrated that ordinary [[Euclidean space]] is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by [[Riemann]] in his 1867 inauguration lecture ''Ãœber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (''On the hypotheses on which geometry is based''),&lt;ref>http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/&lt;/ref> published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]], which considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.

===Dimension===
Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a [[line (geometry)|line]]), 2 (a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as [[three-dimensional space]]), mathematicians have used [[higher dimension]]s for nearly two centuries. Dimension has gone through stages of being any [[natural number]] ''n'', possibly infinite with the introduction of [[Hilbert space]], and any positive real number in [[fractal geometry]]. [[Dimension theory]] is a technical area, initially within [[general topology]], that discusses ''definitions''; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected [[topological manifold]]s have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem ([[invariance of domain]]) rather than anything ''a priori''.

The issue of dimension still matters to geometry, in the absence of complete answers to classic questions. Dimensions 3 of space and 4 of [[space-time]] are special cases in [[geometric topology]]. Dimension 10 or 11 is a key number in [[string theory]]. Research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' reason for the significance of 10 and 11 dimensions. &lt;!-- Exactly why is something to which research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' answer.-->

===Symmetry===
[[File:Order-3 heptakis heptagonal tiling.png|right|thumb|A [[Order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling|tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]]]
The theme of [[symmetry]] in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the [[circle]], [[regular polygon]]s and [[platonic solid]]s held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of [[M. C. Escher]]. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation [[group (mathematics)|group]], determines what geometry ''is''. Symmetry in classical [[Euclidean geometry]] is represented by [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]]s and rigid motions, whereas in [[projective geometry]] an analogous role is played by [[collineation]]s, geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] and Klein, and [[Sophus Lie]] that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its [[symmetry group]]' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in [[topology]] and [[geometric group theory]], the latter in [[Lie theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]].

A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in [[projective geometry]] (see [[Duality (projective geometry)]]) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any [[theorem]], exchange ''point'' with ''plane'', ''join'' with ''meet'', ''lies in'' with ''contains'', and you will get an equally true theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a [[vector space]] and its dual space.

In the 7th century BC, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]] used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore.  He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]].&lt;ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref>  Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], which is credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref>Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, ISBN 0-03-029558-0.&lt;/ref>  though the statement of the theorem has a long history&lt;ref>{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R.

Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']], widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time,&lt;ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}}&lt;/ref> introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[mathematics in medieval Islam]] contributed to the development of geometry, especially [[algebraic geometry]]&lt;ref>R. Rashed (1994), ''The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra'', [[London]]&lt;/ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}  and [[geometric algebra]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots">{{Cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=The Arabic Hegemony|pages=241â€“242|quote=Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050â€“1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an ''Algebra'' that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance.

Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle.

In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by [[RenÃ© Descartes]] (1596â€“1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601â€“1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591â€“1661). Projective geometry is a geometry without measurement or parallel lines, just the study of how points are related to each other.

Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously. These were the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] (1792â€“1856), [[JÃ¡nos Bolyai]] (1802â€“1860) and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777â€“1855) and of the formulation of [[symmetry]] as the central consideration in the [[Erlangen Programme]] of [[Felix Klein]] (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826â€“1866), working primarily with tools from [[mathematical analysis]], and introducing the [[Riemann surface]], and [[Henri PoincarÃ©]], the founder of [[algebraic topology]] and the geometric theory of [[dynamical system]]s. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as [[complex analysis]] and [[classical mechanics]].

==Contemporary geometry==
===Euclidean geometry===
[[File:E8Petrie.svg|right|thumb|120px|The [[4 21 polytope|4&lt;sub>21&lt;/sub>polytope]], orthogonally projected into the [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub>]] [[Lie group]] [[Coxeter plane]]]]
Euclidean geometry has become closely connected with [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]], [[convex geometry]], [[discrete geometry]], and some areas of [[combinatorics]]. Momentum was given to further work on Euclidean geometry and the Euclidean groups by [[crystallography]] and the work of [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and can be seen in theories of [[Coxeter group]]s and polytopes. [[Geometric group theory]] is an expanding area of the theory of more general [[discrete group]]s, drawing on geometric models and algebraic techniques.

===Differential geometry===
[[Differential geometry]] has been of increasing importance to [[mathematical physics]] due to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] postulation that the [[universe]] is [[curvature|curved]]. Contemporary differential geometry is ''intrinsic'', meaning that the spaces it considers are [[smooth manifold]]s whose geometric structure is governed by a [[Riemannian metric]], which determines how distances are measured near each point, and not ''a priori'' parts of some ambient flat Euclidean space.

===Topology and geometry===
[[File:Trefoil knot arb.png|thumb|right|120 px|A thickening of the [[trefoil knot]]]]
The field of [[topology]], which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in a technical sense a type of [[transformation geometry]], in which transformations are [[homeomorphism]]s. This has often been expressed in the form of the dictum 'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Contemporary [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], and particular subfields such as [[Morse theory]], would be counted by most mathematicians as part of geometry. [[Algebraic topology]] and [[general topology]] have gone their own ways.

===Algebraic geometry===
[[File:Calabi yau.jpg|thumb|120px|Quintic [[Calabiâ€“Yau manifold|Calabiâ€“Yau threefold]]]]
The field of [[algebraic geometry]] is the modern incarnation of the [[Cartesian geometry]] of [[co-ordinates]]. From late 1950s through mid-1970s it had undergone major foundational development, largely due to work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. This led to the introduction of [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|schemes]] and greater emphasis on [[algebraic topology|topological]] methods, including various [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]]. One of seven [[Millennium Prize problems]], the [[Hodge conjecture]], is a question in algebraic geometry.

The study of low dimensional algebraic varieties, [[algebraic curve]]s, [[algebraic surface]]s and algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ("algebraic threefolds"), has been far advanced. [[GrÃ¶bner basis]] theory and [[real algebraic geometry]] are among more applied subfields of modern algebraic geometry. [[Arithmetic geometry]] is an active field combining algebraic geometry and [[number theory]]. Other directions of research involve [[moduli space]]s and [[complex geometry]]. Algebro-geometric methods are commonly applied in [[string theory|string]] and [[brane theory|brane]] &lt;!--This comment might stop AWB messing up the formatting here--> theory.
