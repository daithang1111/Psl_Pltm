Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the formulation and study of mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in [[pure mathematics]], where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.  ==History== [[File:Elmer-pump-heatequation.png|thumb|right|A numerical solution to the [[heat equation]] on a pump casing [[Mathematical model|model]] using the [[finite element method]].]] Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably [[differential equations]]; [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] methods, [[Calculus of variations|variational methods]], and [[numerical analysis]]); and applied [[probability]].  These areas of mathematics were intimately tied to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and in fact the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century.  This history left a legacy as well: until the early 20th century subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in [[physics]] departments, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.&lt;ref name=Stolz2002>{{Citation | title = The History Of Applied Mathematics And The History Of Society | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/T152575218M865W4.pdf | year = 2002 | author = Stolz, M. | journal = Synthese | pages = 43â€“57 | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | accessdate = 2009-07-07 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020823608217 }}&lt;/ref> [[Engineering]] and [[computer science]] departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics.  ==Divisions== [[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|left|thumb|[[Fluid mechanics]] is often considered a branch of applied mathematics.]] Today, the term "applied mathematics" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas above, as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as [[number theory]] that are part of [[pure mathematics]] are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''. Sometimes, the term "applicable mathematics" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.  There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees.  Many mathematicians distinguish between "applied mathematics", which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the "applications of mathematics" within science and engineering. A [[biology|biologist]] using a [[Matrix population models|population model]] and applying known mathematics would not be ''doing'' applied mathematics, but rather ''using'' it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as [[Henri PoincarÃ©|PoincarÃ©]] and [[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold]] deny the existence of "applied mathematics" and claim that there are only "applications of mathematics"; similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called "industrial mathematics".&lt;ref>{{citation | author=University of Strathclyde | title=Industrial Mathematics | url=http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref>  The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]], which use [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary disciplines.  ==Utility== [[File:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|right|thumb|[[Mathematical finance]] is concerned with the modelling of financial markets.]] Historically, mathematics was most important in the [[natural sciences]] and [[engineering]]. However, since [[World War II]], fields outside of the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as [[game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], which grew out of economic considerations, or [[neural networks]], which arose out of the study of the brain in [[neuroscience]].  The advent of the computer has created new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ([[computer science]]), using computers to study problems arising in other areas of science ([[computational science]]), and studying the mathematics of computation (for example, [[theoretical computer science]], [[computer algebra]], [[numerical analysis]]).  [[Statistics]] is probably the most widespread [[mathematical science]] used in the [[social sciences]], but other areas of mathematics are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines, most notably in [[economics]].  ==Status in academic departments== {{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}} Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics.  At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics.  It is very common for Statistics departments to be separate at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department.  Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications.  Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside of mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application.  In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between "application of mathematics" and "applied mathematics".  Some universities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] host departments of ''Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics'',&lt;ref>For example see, [http://www.tait.ac.uk/History.html  The Tait Institute: History (2nd par.)]. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref> but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], housing the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] whose past holders include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[James Lighthill]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].  Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from [[Brown University]], which has a well-known and large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the [[doctorate]], to [[Santa Clara University]], which offers only the [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in applied mathematics.&lt;ref>{{Citation | title = Santa Clara University Dept of Applied Mathematics | url = http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm | accessdate = 2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref>  Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include [[Harvard]] and [[MIT]].  ==Other associated mathematical sciences== [[File:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|right|Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with [[statistics]].]] Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.  ===Scientific computing=== [[Scientific computing]] includes applied mathematics (especially [[numerical analysis]]), [[computing science]] (especially [[high-performance computing]]), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline.  ===Computer science=== [[Computer science]] relies on [[logic]], [[algebra]], and [[combinatorics]].  ===Operations research and management science=== [[Operations research]] and [[management science]] are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, public policy.  ===Statistics=== Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of [[statistics]]. [[Statisticians|Statistical theorists]] study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[optimal decision|decision theory]], and makes extensive use of [[scientific computing]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]; for the [[design of experiments]], statisticians use [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design]]. Applied mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).  ===Actuarial science=== [[Actuarial science]] uses [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[economic theory]].  ===Economics=== {{Main|Mathematical economics}} According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91: :Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences  with [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 MSC2010] classifications for '[[Game theory]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Axx 91Axx] and for '[[Mathematical economics]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Bxx  91Bxx].

In it, a "Subject Index" includes mathematical entries under 2 headings (vol. IV, pp.&amp;nbsp;982â€“3): :Mathematical Economics (24 listed, such as "acyclicity", "[[aggregation problem]]", "[[comparative statics]]", "[[lexicographic ordering]]s", "[[linear models]]", "[[order (mathematics)|order]]ings", and "[[qualitative economics]]") :Mathematical Methods (42 listed, such as "[[calculus of variations]]", "[[catastrophe theory]]", "[[combinatorics]]," "[[Computable general equilibrium|computation of general equilibrium]]", "[[convexity in economics|convexity]]", "[[convex programming]]", and "stochastic [[optimal control]]").  A widely used system in [[economics]] that includes mathematical methods on the subject is the [[JEL classification codes]].

The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term ''[[enumeration]]'' refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a [[Finite set|finite]] (combinatorial) [[Set (mathematics)|set]] or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.  [[Image:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|thumb|right|Counting using [[tally marks]] at [[Hanakapiai Beach]]]] Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or "counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).  There is archeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000 years.&lt;ref>''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'' (6th Edition) by [[Howard Eves]] (1990) p.9&lt;/ref> Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts  (i.e., [[accountancy]]). The development of counting led to the development of [[mathematical notation]], [[numeral system]]s, and [[writing]].  ==Forms of counting== {{see|Prehistoric numerals|Numerical digit}} Counting can occur in a variety of forms.  Counting can be verbal; that is, speaking every number out loud (or mentally) to keep track of progress. This is often used to count objects that are present already, instead of counting a variety of things over time.  Counting can also be in the form of [[tally marks]], making a mark for each number and then counting all of the marks when done tallying. This is useful when counting objects over time, such as the number of times something occurs during the course of a day. Tallying is base 1 counting; normal counting is done in base 10. Computers use base 2 counting (0's and 1's).  Counting can also be in the form of [[finger counting]], especially when counting small numbers. This is often used by children to facilitate counting and simple mathematical operations. &lt;!--Um, are you kidding? Your sentence above contains circular logic: "Counting is often used ... to facilitate counting..."--> Finger-counting uses unary notation (one finger = one unit), and is thus limited to counting 10 (unless you start in with your toes). Other hand-gesture systems are also in use, for example the Chinese system by which one can count 10 using only gestures of one hand. By using [[finger binary]] (base 2 counting), it is possible to keep a finger count up to {{nowrap|1=1023 = 2&lt;sup>10&lt;/sup> âˆ’ 1}}.  Various devices can also be used to facilitate counting, such as hand tally counters and abacuses.  ==Inclusive counting== Inclusive counting is usually encountered when counting days in a calendar. Normally when counting "8" days from Sunday, Monday will be ''day 1'', Tuesday ''day 2'', and the following Monday will be the ''eighth day''. When counting "inclusively," the Sunday (the start day) will be ''day 1'' and therefore the following Sunday will be the ''eighth day''. For example, the French phrase for "fortnight" is ''en quinze'' (in 15 [days]), and similar words are present in Greek (Î´ÎµÎºÎ±Ï€ÎµÎ½Î¸Î®Î¼ÎµÏ?Î¿, ''dekapenthÃ­mero''), Spanish (''quincena'') and Portuguese (''quinzena'') - whereas "a fortnight" derives from "a fourteen-night", as the archaic "a sennight" does from "a seven-night".  This practice appears in other calendars as well; in the Roman calendar the ''nones'' (meaning "nine") is 8 days before the ''ides''; and in the Christian calendar [[Quinquagesima]] (meaning 50) is 49 days before Easter Sunday.  The Jewish people also counted{{When|date=September 2011}} days inclusively. For instance, [[Jesus]] announced he would [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|die and resurrect]] "on the third day," i.e. two days later. Scholars{{who|date=January 2012}} most commonly place his crucifixion on a Friday afternoon and his resurrection on Sunday before sunrise, spanning three different days but a period of around 36â€“40 hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Musical terminology also uses inclusive counting of [[interval (music)|intervals]] between notes of the standard scale: going up one note is a second interval, going up two notes is a third interval, etc., and going up seven notes is an octave.  ==Education and development== {{Main|Pre-math skills}} Learning to count is an important educational/developmental milestone in most cultures of the world. Learning to count is a child's very first step into mathematics, and constitutes the most fundamental idea of that discipline. However, some cultures in Amazonia and the Australian Outback do not count,&lt;ref>[[Brian Butterworth|Butterworth, B.]], Reeve, R., Reynolds, F., &amp; Lloyd, D. (2008). Numerical thought with and without words: Evidence from indigenous Australian children. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105(35), 13179â€“13184.&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>Gordon, P. (2004). Numerical cognition without words: Evidence from Amazonia. Science, 306, 496â€“499.&lt;/ref> and their languages do not have number words.  Many children at just 2 years of age have some skill in reciting the count list (i.e., saying "one, two, three, ..."). They can also answer questions of ordinality for small numbers, e.g., "What comes after ''three''?". They can even be skilled at pointing to each object in a set and reciting the words one after another. This leads many parents and educators to the conclusion that the child knows how to use counting to determine the size of a set.&lt;ref>Fuson, K.C. (1988). Children's counting and concepts of number. New York: Springerâ€“Verlag.&lt;/ref> Research suggests that it takes about a year after learning these skills for a child to understand what they mean and why the procedures are performed.&lt;ref>Le Corre, M., &amp; Carey, S.

Children with [[Williams syndrome]] often display serious delays in learning to count.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  ==Counting in mathematics==  In mathematics, the essence of counting a set and finding a result ''n'', is that it establishes a [[one to one correspondence]] (or bijection) of the set with the set of numbers {1, 2, ..., ''n''}. A fundamental fact, which can be proved by [[mathematical induction]], is that no bijection can exist between {1, 2, ..., ''n''} and {1, 2, ..., ''m''} unless ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''; this fact (together with the fact that two bijections can be [[function composition|composed]] to give another bijection) ensures that counting the same set in different ways can never result in different numbers (unless an error is made). This is the fundamental mathematical theorem that gives counting its purpose; however you count a (finite) set, the answer is the same. In a broader context, the theorem is an example of a theorem in the mathematical field of (finite) [[combinatorics]]â€”hence (finite) combinatorics is sometimes referred to as "the mathematics of counting."  Many sets that arise in mathematics do not allow a bijection to be established with {1, 2, ..., ''n''} for ''any'' [[natural number]] ''n''; these are called [[infinite set]]s, while those sets for which such a bijection does exist (for some ''n'') are called [[finite set]]s. Infinite sets cannot be counted in the usual sense; for one thing, the mathematical theorems which underlie this usual sense for finite sets are false for infinite sets. Furthermore, different definitions of the concepts in terms of which these theorems are stated, while equivalent for finite sets, are inequivalent in the context of infinite sets.  The notion of counting may be extended to them in the sense of establishing (the existence of) a bijection with some well understood set. For instance, if a set can be brought into bijection with the set of all natural numbers, then it is called "[[countably infinite]]." This kind of counting differs in a fundamental way from counting of finite sets, in that adding new elements to a set does not necessarily increase its size, because the possibility of a bijection with the original set is not excluded. For instance, the set of all [[integer]]s (including negative numbers) can be brought into bijection with the set of natural numbers, and even seemingly much larger sets like that of all finite sequences of rational numbers are still (only) countably infinite. Nevertheless there are sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, that can be shown to be "too large" to admit a bijection with the natural numbers, and these sets are called "[[uncountable set|uncountable]]." Sets for which there exists a bijection between them are said to have the same [[cardinality]], and in the most general sense counting a set can be taken to mean determining its cardinality. Beyond the cardinalities given by each of the natural numbers, there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite cardinalities, although only very few such cardinalities occur in ordinary mathematics (that is, outside [[set theory]] that explicitly studies possible cardinalities).  Counting, mostly of finite sets, has various applications in mathematics. One important principle is that if two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same finite number of elements, and a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' â†’ ''Y''}} is known to be [[injective]], then it is also [[surjective]], and vice versa. A related fact is known as the [[pigeonhole principle]], which states that if two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' have finite numbers of elements ''n'' and ''m'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;>&amp;nbsp;''m'', then any map {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' â†’ ''Y''}} is ''not'' injective (so there exist two distinct elements of ''X'' that ''f'' sends to the same element of ''Y''); this follows from the former principle, since if ''f'' were injective, then so would its [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] to a strict subset ''S'' of ''X'' with ''m'' elements, which restriction would then be surjective, contradicting the fact that for ''x'' in ''X'' outside ''S'', ''f''(''x'') cannot be in the image of the restriction. Similar counting arguments can prove the existence of certain objects without explicitly providing an example. In the case of infinite sets this can even apply in situations where it is impossible to give an example; for instance there must exists real numbers that are not [[computable number]]s, because the latter set is only countably infinite, but by definition a non-computable number cannot be precisely specified.  The domain of [[enumerative combinatorics]] deals with computing the number of elements of finite sets, without actually counting them; the latter usually being impossible because infinite families of finite sets are considered at once, such as the set of [[permutation]]s of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} for any natural number ''n''.  ==See also== &lt;div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> * [[Kirby Lester Pharmacy Automation|Automated pill counter]] * [[Cardinal number]] * [[Combinatorics]] * [[Counting (music)]] * [[Counting problem (complexity)]] * [[Developmental psychology]] * [[Elementary arithmetic]] * [[Finger counting]] * [[History of mathematics]] * [[Jeton]] * [[Level of measurement]] * [[Ordinal number]] * [[Subitizing and counting]] * [[Tally mark]] * [[Unary numeral system]] * [[List of numbers]] * [[List of numbers in various languages]] &lt;/div>  ==References==&lt;!--CurrBiol17:R1004.--> {{Reflist}}  ==External links== * [http://www.plainmath.net/index.php?page=counting History of Counting-PlainMath.Net]  [[Category:Elementary mathematics]] [[Category:Numeral systems]] [[Category:Mathematical logic]]  [[ca:Comptar]]

There are many different FFT algorithms involving a wide range of mathematics, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]]; this article gives an overview of the available techniques and some of their general properties, while the specific algorithms are described in subsidiary articles linked below.  The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.  This operation is useful in many fields (see [[discrete Fourier transform]] for properties and applications of the transform) but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical.  An FFT is a way to compute the same result more quickly: computing the DFT of ''N'' points in the naive way, using the definition, takes [[Big O notation|O]](''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>) arithmetical operations, while an FFT can compute the same DFT in only O(''N'' log ''N'') operations.  The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In practice, the computation time can be reduced by several [[orders of magnitude]] in such cases, and the improvement is roughly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional to]] ''N'' / log(''N'').  This huge improvement made the calculation of the DFT practical; FFTs are of great importance to a wide variety of applications, from [[digital signal processing]] and solving [[partial differential equation]]s to algorithms for quick [[multiplication algorithm|multiplication of large integers]].  The best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with O(''N''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N'') [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]] ''N''.  Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that &lt;math>e^{-{2\pi i \over N}}&lt;/math> is an ''N''-th  [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s.  Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.  The FFT has been described as "the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime".&lt;ref>(Strang, 1994)&lt;/ref>  ==Definition and speed== An FFT computes the [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] and produces exactly the same result as evaluating the DFT definition directly; the only difference is that an FFT is much faster.  (In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are also much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly, as discussed below.)  Let ''x''&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>, ...., ''x''&lt;sub>''N''-1&lt;/sub> be [[complex number]]s. The DFT is defined by the formula  :&lt;math> X_k =  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-{i 2\pi k \frac{n}{N}}} \qquad k = 0,\dots,N-1. &lt;/math>  Evaluating this definition directly requires O(''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>) operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''&lt;sub>''k''&lt;/sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms.  An FFT is any method to compute the same results in O(''N'' log ''N'') operations.  More precisely, all known FFT algorithms require [[Big_O_notation#Use_in_computer_science|Î˜]](''N'' log ''N'') operations (technically, O only denotes an [[upper bound]]), although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.  To illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions.  Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N''âˆ’1) complex additions [of which O(''N'') operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1].  The well-known radix-2 [[#Cooley.E2.80.93Tukey_algorithm|Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>(''N'') complex multiplies (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''log&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>(''N'') complex additions.   In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (see, e.g., Frigo &amp; Johnson, 2005), but the overall improvement from O(''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>) to O(''N'' log ''N'') remains.  ==Algorithms==  === Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm === {{main|Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm}}  By far the most commonly used FFT is the [[Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooleyâ€“Tukey]] algorithm.  This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>''N''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> and ''N''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966).  This method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of [[J. W. Cooley]] and [[J. W. Tukey]] in 1965,&lt;ref name=mc465ct>* {{cite journal |last1=Cooley |first1=James W. |first2=John W. |last2=Tukey |authorlink2=John W. Tukey |year=1965 |title=An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series |journal=Math. Comput. |volume=19 |doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1 |issue=90 |pages=297&amp;ndash;301 }}&lt;/ref>  but it was later discovered (Heideman &amp; Burrus, 1984) that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to  [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805 (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).  The most well-known use of the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey).  These are called the '''radix-2''' and '''mixed-radix''' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.  === Other FFT algorithms === {{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm}}  There are other FFT algorithms distinct from Cooleyâ€“Tukey.  For ''N'' = ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>''N''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> and ''N''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Prime-Factor]] (Good-Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooleyâ€“Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader-Brenner algorithm (1976) is a Cooleyâ€“Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooleyâ€“Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader-Brenner and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''n''.  Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.)  [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z&lt;sup>N&lt;/sup>''âˆ’1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z&lt;sup>M&lt;/sup>''âˆ’1 and  ''z&lt;sup>2M&lt;/sup>'' + ''az&lt;sup>M&lt;/sup>'' + 1.  Another polynomial viewpoint is  exploited by the [[Winograd FFT algorithm|Winograd algorithm]], which factorizes ''z&lt;sup>N&lt;/sup>''âˆ’1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]sâ€”these often have coefficients of 1, 0, or âˆ’1, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors.  Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.  [[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''n'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N''âˆ’1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]]  (although Winograd uses other convolution methods).  Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity  &lt;math>nk = -(k-n)^2/2 + n^2/2 + k^2/2&lt;/math>.  == FFT algorithms specialized for real and/or symmetric data == In many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry :&lt;math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*,&lt;/math> and efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).  One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooleyâ€“Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory.  Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.  It was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs. Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.  There are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of (roughly) two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the discrete cosine/sine transform(s) ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre/post processing.  ==Computational issues==  === Bounds on complexity and operation counts === {{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than Î˜(N log N)?}} A fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain.  It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Î©(''N''log(''N'')) (i.e., order ''N''log(''N'') or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known.  In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.  Following pioneering work by [[Shmuel Winograd|Winograd]] (1978), a tight Î˜(''N'') lower bound ''is'' known for the [[Arithmetic complexity of the discrete Fourier transform|number of real multiplications required by an FFT]].  It can be shown that only &lt;math>4N-2\log_2^{2}N-2\log_2 N-4&lt;/math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length &lt;math>N=2^m&lt;/math>.  Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman &amp; Burrus, 1986; Duhamel, 1990).  Unfortunately, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  A tight lower bound is ''not'' known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms.  In 1973, Morgenstern proved an Î©(''N''log(''N'')) lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms).  Pan (1986) proved an Î©(''N''log(''N'')) lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's "asynchronicity", but the generality of this assumption is unclear.  For the case of power-of-two ''N'', Papadimitriou (1979) argued that the number &lt;math>N \log_2 N&lt;/math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited).  (This argument would imply that at least &lt;math>2 N \log_2 N&lt;/math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than &lt;math>N \log_2 N&lt;/math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two ''N''.  A third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the "arithmetic complexity" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven.  Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires &lt;math>4N\log_2 N-6N+8&lt;/math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1.  This was recently reduced to &lt;math>\sim \frac{34}{9} N \log_2 N&lt;/math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007; Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007).  A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N''â‰¥256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N''â‰¤512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[Satisfiability Modulo Theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal &amp; Haynal, 2011).  Most of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest.  However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel &amp; Vetterli, 1990).  === Accuracy and approximations === All of the FFT algorithms discussed below compute the DFT exactly (in exact arithmetic, i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors).  A few "FFT" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations.  Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties.  For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999) achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]].  A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996) takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT.  Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).  The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data.  Conversely, if the data are sparse&amp;mdash;that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero&amp;mdash;then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''log(''N'')log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for N/K&amp;gt;32 in a large-N example (N=2&lt;sup>22&lt;/sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).&lt;ref name=Hassanieh12>Haitham Hassanieh, Piotr Indyk, Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/paper.pdf Simple and Practical Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}," ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA), Kyoto, January 2012.  See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref>  Even the "exact" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooleyâ€“Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm is O(Îµ log ''N''), compared to O(Îµ''N''&lt;sup>3/2&lt;/sup>) for the naÃ¯ve DFT formula (Gentleman and Sande, 1966), where Îµ is the machine floating-point relative precision.  In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(Îµ âˆšlog ''N'') for Cooleyâ€“Tukey and O(Îµ âˆš''N'') for the naÃ¯ve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).  These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas.  Some FFTs other than Cooleyâ€“Tukey, such as the Rader-Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.  In [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O(âˆš''N'') for the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).  Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling in order to minimize the loss of precision, and [[fixed-point FFT algorithms]] involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooleyâ€“Tukey.  To verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''log(''N'')) time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (ErgÃ¼n, 1995).  ==Multidimensional FFTs==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->  As defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT  :&lt;math>X_\mathbf{k} = \sum_{\mathbf{n}=0}^{\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\pi i \mathbf{k} \cdot (\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N})} x_\mathbf{n}&lt;/math>  transforms an array ''x''&lt;sub>'''n'''&lt;/sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices &lt;math>\mathbf{n}=(n_1, \ldots, n_d)&lt;/math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over &lt;math>n_j = 0 \ldots N_j-1&lt;/math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as &lt;math>\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N} = (n_1/N_1, \ldots, n_d/N_d)&lt;/math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is simply the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).  This compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below).  That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> dimension, then along the ''n''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering will work).  This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''log(''N'')) complexity, where ''N'' = ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> \cdots ''N&lt;sub>d&lt;/sub>'' is the total number of data points transformed.  In particular, there are ''N''/''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> transforms of size ''N''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:  :&lt;math>\begin{align} &amp; {} \qquad  \frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \log N_1) + \cdots + \frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \log N_d) \\[6pt] &amp; = O\left(N \left[\log N_1 + \cdots + \log N_d\right]\right) = O(N \log N). \end{align}&lt;/math>  In two dimensions, the ''x''&lt;sub>'''k'''&lt;/sub> can be viewed as an &lt;math>n_1 \times n_2&lt;/math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows and then of all the columns (or vice versa), hence the name.  In more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar "slice" for each fixed ''n''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> direction.  More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups &lt;math>(n_1, \ldots, n_{d/2})&lt;/math> and &lt;math>(n_{d/2+1}, \ldots, n_d)&lt;/math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).  Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''log(''N'')) complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.  There are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''log(''N'')) complexity.  Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector &lt;math>\mathbf{r}=(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_d)&lt;/math> of radices at each step.  (This may also have cache benefits.)  The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. &lt;math>\mathbf{r}=(1, \ldots, 1, r, 1, \ldots, 1)&lt;/math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977), which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products.  See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990) for more information and references.  ==Other generalizations== An O(''N''&lt;sup>5/2&lt;/sup>log(''N'')) generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> with ''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp (1999), along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> log&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the [http://www.math.ohiou.edu/~mjm/research/libftsh.html libftsh library].  A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>log(''N'')) complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert (2006).  The [[Fast Folding Algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values.  Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.  Various groups have also published "FFT" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).  Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately).  ==See also== * [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm]] * [[Bruun's FFT algorithm]] * [[Rader's FFT algorithm]] * [[Bluestein's FFT algorithm]] * [[Butterfly diagram]] â€“ a diagram used to describe FFTs. * [[Odlyzko&amp;ndash;SchÃ¶nhage algorithm]] applies the FFT to finite [[Dirichlet series]]. * [[Overlap add]]/[[Overlap save]] â€“ efficient convolution methods using FFT for long signals * [[Spectral music]] (involves application of FFT analysis to musical composition) * [[Spectrum analyzer]]s â€“ Devices that perform an FFT * [[FFTW]] "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West" - C library for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions. * [[FFTPACK]] â€“ another Fortran FFT library (public domain) * [[Time Series]] * [[Math Kernel Library]] * [[Fast Walshâ€“Hadamard transform]] *  [[Generalized distributive law|Generalized Distributive Law]]  == References ==  &lt;references /> * {{cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Brenner |first2=C. |last2=Rader |year=1976 |title= A New Principle for Fast Fourier Transformation |journal=IEEE Acoustics, Speech &amp; Signal Processing |volume=24 |issue=3 |doi=10.1109/TASSP.1976.1162805 |pages=264&amp;ndash;266 }} * {{Cite document|first=E.

A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.  Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a body of practical knowledge concerning [[length]]s, [[area]]s, and [[volume]]s, with elements of a formal mathematical science emerging in the West as early as [[Thales]] (6th Century BC).  By the 3rd century BC geometry was put into an [[axiomatic system|axiomatic form]] by [[Euclid]], whose treatmentâ€”[[Euclidean geometry]]â€”set a standard for many centuries to follow.&lt;ref>Martin J. Turner,Jonathan M. Blackledge,Patrick R. Andrews (1998).

ISBN 0-12-703970-8&lt;/ref> [[Archimedes]] developed ingenious techniques for calculating areas and volumes, in many ways anticipating modern [[integral calculus]].  The field of [[astronomy]], especially mapping the positions of the [[star]]s and [[planet]]s on the [[celestial sphere]] and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, served as an important source of geometric problems during the next one and a half millennia.  Both geometry and astronomy were considered in the classical world to be part of the [[Quadrivium]], a subset of the seven [[liberal arts#History|liberal arts]] considered essential for a free citizen to master.  The introduction of [[coordinates]] by [[RenÃ© Descartes]] and the concurrent developments of [[algebra]] marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures, such as [[plane curve]]s, could now be represented [[analytic geometry|analytically]], i.e., with functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in the 17th century. Furthermore, the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of [[projective geometry]]. The subject of geometry was further enriched by the study of intrinsic structure of geometric objects that originated with [[Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and led to the creation of [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]].  In Euclid's time there was no clear distinction between physical space and geometrical space. Since the 19th-century discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the concept of [[space]] has undergone a radical transformation, and the question arose: which geometrical space best fits physical space? With the rise of formal mathematics in the 20th century, also 'space' (and 'point', 'line', 'plane') lost its intuitive contents, so today we have to distinguish between physical space, geometrical spaces (in which 'space', 'point' etc. still have their intuitive meaning) and abstract spaces. Contemporary geometry considers [[manifold]]s, spaces that are considerably more abstract than the familiar [[Euclidean space]], which they only approximately resemble at small scales. These spaces may be endowed with additional structure, allowing one to speak about length. Modern geometry has multiple strong bonds with [[physics]], exemplified by the ties between [[pseudo-Riemannian]] geometry and [[general relativity]]. One of the youngest physical theories, [[string theory]], is also very geometric in flavour.  While the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than other parts of mathematics, such as algebra or [[number theory]], geometric language is also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance (for example, in [[fractal geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]).&lt;ref>It is quite common in algebraic geometry to speak about ''geometry of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s'', possibly [[singularity theory|singular]]. From a naÃ¯ve perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by invoking powerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric techniques, it is possible to find structure and establish properties that make them somewhat analogous to the ordinary [[sphere]]s or [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]s.&lt;/ref>  ==Overview== [[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Visual [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for the (3, 4, 5) [[triangle]] as in the [[Chou Pei Suan Ching]] 500â€“200&amp;nbsp;BC.]]  The recorded development of geometry spans more than two [[millennia]]. It is hardly surprising that perceptions of what constituted geometry evolved throughout the ages.  ===Practical geometry=== Geometry originated as a practical science concerned with surveying, measurements, areas, and volumes. Among the notable accomplishments one finds formulas for  [[length]]s, [[area]]s and [[volume]]s, such as [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[circumference]] and [[area of a disk|area]] of a circle, area of a [[triangle]], volume of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], and a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]. A method of computing certain inaccessible distances or heights based on [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] of geometric figures is attributed to [[Thales]]. Development of [[astronomy]] led to emergence of [[trigonometry]] and [[spherical trigonometry]], together with the attendant computational techniques.  ===Axiomatic geometry=== [[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of Euclid's [[parallel postulate]]]] {{See also|Euclidean geometry}} [[Euclid]] took a more abstract approach in his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain [[axiom]]s, or [[postulate]]s, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as ''axiomatic'' or ''[[synthetic geometry|synthetic]]'' geometry. At the start of the 19th century the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Gauss]], [[Lobachevsky]], [[Bolyai]], and others led to a revival of interest, and in the 20th century [[David Hilbert]] employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry. [[File:Geometry Lessons.jpg|thumb|Geometry lessons in the 20th century]]  ===Geometric constructions=== {{Main|Compass and straightedge constructions}} Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[ruler|straightedge]]. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.  ===Numbers in geometry=== [[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a  triangle could have [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lengths.]] In [[ancient Greece]] the [[Pythagoreans]] considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths, which contradicted their philosophical views, made them abandon abstract numbers in favor of concrete geometric quantities, such as length and area of figures. Numbers were reintroduced into geometry in the form of [[coordinate]]s by [[Descartes]], who realized that the study of geometric shapes can be facilitated by their algebraic representation, and whom the [[Cartesian plane]] is named after. [[Analytic geometry]] applies methods of algebra to geometric questions, typically by relating geometric [[curve]]s and algebraic [[equation]]s. These ideas played a key role in the development of [[calculus]] in the 17th century and led to discovery of many new properties of plane curves. Modern [[algebraic geometry]] considers similar questions on a vastly more abstract level.  ===Geometry of position=== {{Main|Projective geometry|Topology}} Even in ancient times, geometers considered questions of relative position or spatial relationship of geometric figures and shapes. Some examples are given by inscribed and circumscribed circles of [[polygon]]s, lines intersecting and tangent to [[conic section]]s, the [[Pappus configuration|Pappus]] and [[Menelaus theorem|Menelaus]] configurations of points and lines. In the Middle Ages new and more complicated questions of this type were considered: What is the maximum number of spheres simultaneously touching a given sphere of the same radius ([[kissing number problem]])? What is the densest [[sphere packing|packing of spheres]] of equal size in space ([[Kepler conjecture]])? Most of these questions involved 'rigid' geometrical shapes, such as lines or spheres. [[Projective geometry|Projective]], [[Convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] are three sub-disciplines within present day geometry that deal with these and related questions.  [[Leonhard Euler]], in studying problems like the [[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg]], considered the most fundamental properties of geometric figures based solely on shape, independent of their metric properties. Euler called this new branch of geometry ''geometria situs'' (geometry of place), but it is now known as [[topology]]. Topology grew out of geometry, but turned into a large independent discipline. It does not differentiate between objects that can be continuously deformed into each other. The objects may nevertheless retain some geometry, as in the case of [[hyperbolic knot]]s.  ===Geometry beyond Euclid=== [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|right|[[Differential geometry]] uses tools from [[calculus]] to study problems in geometry.]] For nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, basic understanding of [[space]] remained essentially the same. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that there is only one, ''absolute'', geometry, which is known to be true ''a priori'' by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was [[synthetic a priori]].&lt;ref>Kline (1972) "Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times", Oxford University Press, p. 1032.  Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) ''possibility'' of non-Euclidean geometry, see [[Jeremy Gray]], "Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact ''predicted'' the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, "Philosophy and Axiomatics," Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy, Dover, 1965; p.164.&lt;/ref>  This dominant view was overturned by the revolutionary discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the works of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (who never published his theory), [[Bolyai]], and [[Lobachevsky]], who demonstrated that ordinary [[Euclidean space]] is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by [[Riemann]] in his 1867 inauguration lecture ''Ãœber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (''On the hypotheses on which geometry is based''),&lt;ref>http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/&lt;/ref> published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]], which considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.  ===Dimension=== Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a [[line (geometry)|line]]), 2 (a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as [[three-dimensional space]]), mathematicians have used [[higher dimension]]s for nearly two centuries. Dimension has gone through stages of being any [[natural number]] ''n'', possibly infinite with the introduction of [[Hilbert space]], and any positive real number in [[fractal geometry]]. [[Dimension theory]] is a technical area, initially within [[general topology]], that discusses ''definitions''; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected [[topological manifold]]s have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem ([[invariance of domain]]) rather than anything ''a priori''.  The issue of dimension still matters to geometry, in the absence of complete answers to classic questions. Dimensions 3 of space and 4 of [[space-time]] are special cases in [[geometric topology]]. Dimension 10 or 11 is a key number in [[string theory]]. Research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' reason for the significance of 10 and 11 dimensions. &lt;!-- Exactly why is something to which research may bring a satisfactory ''geometric'' answer.-->  ===Symmetry=== [[File:Order-3 heptakis heptagonal tiling.png|right|thumb|A [[Order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling|tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]]] The theme of [[symmetry]] in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the [[circle]], [[regular polygon]]s and [[platonic solid]]s held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of [[M. C. Escher]]. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation [[group (mathematics)|group]], determines what geometry ''is''. Symmetry in classical [[Euclidean geometry]] is represented by [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]]s and rigid motions, whereas in [[projective geometry]] an analogous role is played by [[collineation]]s, geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] and Klein, and [[Sophus Lie]] that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its [[symmetry group]]' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in [[topology]] and [[geometric group theory]], the latter in [[Lie theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]].  A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in [[projective geometry]] (see [[Duality (projective geometry)]]) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any [[theorem]], exchange ''point'' with ''plane'', ''join'' with ''meet'', ''lies in'' with ''contains'', and you will get an equally true theorem.

Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance.

In essence, their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered, assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investiagtions of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines &amp;ndash; made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') &amp;ndash; was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar Levi ben Gerson, who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}&lt;/ref>  In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by [[RenÃ© Descartes]] (1596â€“1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601â€“1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591â€“1661). Projective geometry is a geometry without measurement or parallel lines, just the study of how points are related to each other.  Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously. These were the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] (1792â€“1856), [[JÃ¡nos Bolyai]] (1802â€“1860) and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777â€“1855) and of the formulation of [[symmetry]] as the central consideration in the [[Erlangen Programme]] of [[Felix Klein]] (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826â€“1866), working primarily with tools from [[mathematical analysis]], and introducing the [[Riemann surface]], and [[Henri PoincarÃ©]], the founder of [[algebraic topology]] and the geometric theory of [[dynamical system]]s. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as [[complex analysis]] and [[classical mechanics]].  ==Contemporary geometry== ===Euclidean geometry=== [[File:E8Petrie.svg|right|thumb|120px|The [[4 21 polytope|4&lt;sub>21&lt;/sub>polytope]], orthogonally projected into the [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub>]] [[Lie group]] [[Coxeter plane]]]] Euclidean geometry has become closely connected with [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]], [[convex geometry]], [[discrete geometry]], and some areas of [[combinatorics]]. Momentum was given to further work on Euclidean geometry and the Euclidean groups by [[crystallography]] and the work of [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and can be seen in theories of [[Coxeter group]]s and polytopes. [[Geometric group theory]] is an expanding area of the theory of more general [[discrete group]]s, drawing on geometric models and algebraic techniques.  ===Differential geometry=== [[Differential geometry]] has been of increasing importance to [[mathematical physics]] due to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] postulation that the [[universe]] is [[curvature|curved]]. Contemporary differential geometry is ''intrinsic'', meaning that the spaces it considers are [[smooth manifold]]s whose geometric structure is governed by a [[Riemannian metric]], which determines how distances are measured near each point, and not ''a priori'' parts of some ambient flat Euclidean space.  ===Topology and geometry=== [[File:Trefoil knot arb.png|thumb|right|120 px|A thickening of the [[trefoil knot]]]] The field of [[topology]], which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in a technical sense a type of [[transformation geometry]], in which transformations are [[homeomorphism]]s. This has often been expressed in the form of the dictum 'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Contemporary [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], and particular subfields such as [[Morse theory]], would be counted by most mathematicians as part of geometry. [[Algebraic topology]] and [[general topology]] have gone their own ways.  ===Algebraic geometry=== [[File:Calabi yau.jpg|thumb|120px|Quintic [[Calabiâ€“Yau manifold|Calabiâ€“Yau threefold]]]] The field of [[algebraic geometry]] is the modern incarnation of the [[Cartesian geometry]] of [[co-ordinates]]. From late 1950s through mid-1970s it had undergone major foundational development, largely due to work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. This led to the introduction of [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|schemes]] and greater emphasis on [[algebraic topology|topological]] methods, including various [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]]. One of seven [[Millennium Prize problems]], the [[Hodge conjecture]], is a question in algebraic geometry.  The study of low dimensional algebraic varieties, [[algebraic curve]]s, [[algebraic surface]]s and algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ("algebraic threefolds"), has been far advanced. [[GrÃ¶bner basis]] theory and [[real algebraic geometry]] are among more applied subfields of modern algebraic geometry. [[Arithmetic geometry]] is an active field combining algebraic geometry and [[number theory]]. Other directions of research involve [[moduli space]]s and [[complex geometry]]. Algebro-geometric methods are commonly applied in [[string theory|string]] and [[brane theory|brane]] &lt;!--This comment might stop AWB messing up the formatting here--> theory.  ==See also== {{Portal|Geometry}}  ===Lists=== * [[List of geometers]] ** [[:Category:Algebraic geometers]] ** [[:Category:Differential geometers]] ** [[:Category:Geometers]] ** [[:Category:Topologists]] * [[List of geometry topics]] * [[List of important publications in mathematics#Geometry|List of important publications in geometry]] * [[List of mathematics articles]]  ===Related topics=== * ''[[Flatland]]'', a book written by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]] about two- and [[three-dimensional space]], to understand the concept of four dimensions * [[Interactive geometry software]] * [[Shulba Sutras]] * [[Trigonometry]]  ==References== ===Notes=== {{Reflist}}  ==Sources== * [[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, C.

He also became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]], which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/ |title=Stephen Thornton, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref> After the June 15, 1919 street battle in the HÃ¶rlgasse, when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades, he became disillusioned by what he saw to be the pseudo-scientific [[historical materialism]] of Marx, abandoned the ideology, and remained a supporter of [[social liberalism]] throughout his life.  He worked in street construction for a short amount of time, but was unable to cope with the heavy labour. Continuing to attend university as a guest student, he started an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker, which he completed as a journeyman. He was dreaming at that time of starting a daycare facility for children, for which he assumed the ability to make furniture might be useful. After that he did voluntary service in one of psychoanalyst [[Alfred Adler]]'s clinics for children. In 1922, he did his [[matura]] by way of a second chance education and finally joined the University as an ordinary student. He completed his examination as an elementary teacher in 1924 and started working at an after-school care club for socially endangered children. In 1925 he went to the newly founded ''PÃ¤dagogisches Institut'' and continued studying philosophy and psychology. Around that time he started dating Josephine Anna Henninger, later to become his wife.  In 1928, he earned a doctorate in psychology, under the supervision of [[Karl BÃ¼hler]]. His dissertation was entitled "Die Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie" (The question of method in cognitive psychology).&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ubwdb/data/ska/m001/z017/h065/a0166412.gif |title=Cf.

He married in 1930. Fearing the rise of [[Nazism]] and the threat of the [[Anschluss]], he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie''. He needed to publish one in order to get some academic position in a country that was safe for people of Jewish descent. However, he ended up not publishing the two-volume work, but a condensed version of it with some new material, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), in 1934. Here, he criticised [[psychologism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[inductionism]], and [[logical positivism]], and put forth his theory of potential [[falsifiability]] as the criterion demarcating science from non-science. In 1935 and 1936, he took unpaid leave to go to England for a study visit.  &lt;!-- [[File:popper 1.jpg|thumb|Gravesite of Sir Karl Popper in {{Ill|de|Lainzer Friedhof}}, [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].]] --> In 1937, Popper finally managed to get a position that allowed him to emigrate to New Zealand, where he became lecturer in philosophy at [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]] of the [[University of New Zealand|New Zealand]] (at [[Christchurch]]). It was here that he wrote his influential work ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]''. In 1946, after the [[Second World War]], he moved to England to become [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[logic]] and [[scientific method]] at the [[London School of Economics]]. Three years later, he was appointed as professor of logic and scientific method at the University of London in 1949. Popper was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1958 to 1959. He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. In 1985, he returned to Austria to let his wife have her relatives around her during the last months of her life. She died in November that year. After the [[Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft]] had failed to establish him as the director of a newly founded branch researching the philosophy of science, he went back again to the United Kingdom in 1986, settling in [[Kenley]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=frs/>  [[File:Popper gravesite.jpg|thumb|Sir Karl Popper's gravesite in {{Ill|de|Lainzer Friedhof}}, near [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].]] Popper died of "complications of cancer, pneumonia and kidney failure" in [[Kenley]] ([[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Croydon]], London) at the age of 92 on 17 September 1994.&lt;ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Sir Karl Popper Is Dead at 92.

Concerning the method of science, the term indicates his rejection of classical [[empiricism]], and the classical [[inductivism|observationalist-inductivist]] account of science that had grown out of it. Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that [[scientific theories]] are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination in order to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings.  Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. The term "[[falsifiable]]" does not mean something is made false, but rather that, if it is false, it can be shown by observation or experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between [[Verification theory|verification]] and [[falsifiability]] lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of [[Demarcation problem|demarcation]] between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both [[psychoanalysis]] and contemporary [[Marxism]] to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable.  Popper also wrote extensively against the famous [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. He strongly disagreed with [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[instrumentalism]] and supported [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[scientific realism|realist]] approach to scientific theories about the universe. Popper's falsifiability resembles [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]'s nineteenth century [[fallibilism]]. In ''Of Clocks and Clouds'' (1966), Popper remarked that he wished he had known of Peirce's work earlier.  In ''All Life is Problem Solving'', Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge â€” that is, how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time. This problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified. Again, in this context the word 'falsified' does not refer to something being 'fake'; rather, that something can be (i.e., is ''capable'' of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment. Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore, are not falsifiable. If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a [[The growth of knowledge|growth in knowledge]]? In Popper's view, the advance of scientific knowledge is an ''evolutionary'' process characterised by his formula:  &lt;math>\mathrm{PS}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{TT}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{EE}_1 \rightarrow \mathrm{PS}_2. \, &lt;/math>  In response to a given problem situation (&lt;math>\mathrm{PS}_1&lt;/math>), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (&lt;math>\mathrm{TT}&lt;/math>), are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible. This process, error elimination (&lt;math>\mathrm{EE}&lt;/math>), performs a similar function for science that [[natural selection]] performs for [[biological evolution]]. Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more "fit"â€”in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (&lt;math>\mathrm{PS}_1&lt;/math>). Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has produced, over time, adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems (&lt;math>\mathrm{PS}_2&lt;/math>). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection.  ====Falsification/problem of induction==== Among his contributions to philosophy is his claim to solve the philosophical [[problem of induction]].  He states that while there is no way to prove that the sun will rise, it is possible to formulate the theory that every day the sun will rise; if it does not rise on some particular day, the theory will be falsified and will have to be replaced by a different one. Until that day, there is no need to reject the assumption that the theory is true. Neither is it rational according to Popper to instead make the more complex assumption that the sun will rise until a given day, but will stop doing so the day after, or similar statements with additional conditions.  Such a theory would be true with higher probability, because it cannot be attacked so easily: to falsify the first one, it is sufficient to find that sun has stopped rising; to falsify the second one, one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached. Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he identified as all the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer. His opposition to positivism, which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer, here becomes very apparent. It is impossible, Popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true; it is more important that their falsity can be detected as easily as possible.  Popper and [[David Hume]] agreed that there is often a psychological belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, but both denied that there is logical justification for the supposition that it will, simply because it always has in the past. Popper writes, "I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified." (''Conjectures and Refutations'', p.&amp;nbsp;55)  ===Rationality=== Popper held that rationality is not restricted to the realm of empirical or scientific theories, but that it is merely a special case of the general method of criticism, the method of finding and eliminating contradictions in knowledge without ad-hoc-measures. According to this view, rational discussion about metaphysical ideas, about moral and even about purposes are possible. Popper's student [[William W. Bartley|Bartley]] tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge, but that everything can be rationally criticised.  To Popper, who was an anti-[[justificationism|justificationist]], traditional philosophy is misled by the false [[principle of sufficient reason]]. He thinks that no assumption can ever be or needs ever to be justified, so a lack of justification is not a justification for doubt. Instead, theories should be tested and scrutinised. It is not the goal to bless theories with claims of certainty or justification, but to eliminate errors in them. He writes, "there ''are'' no such things as good positive reasons; nor do we need such things [...] But [philosophers] obviously cannot quite bring [themselves] to believe that this is my opinion, let alone that it is right" (''The Philosophy of Karl Popper'', p.&amp;nbsp;1043)  ===Philosophy of arithmetic=== Popper's principle of falsifiability runs into ''[[prima facie]]'' difficulties when the epistemological status of mathematics is considered. It is difficult to conceive how simple statements of arithmetic, such as "2 + 2 = 4", could ever be shown to be false. If they are not open to falsification they can not be scientific. If they are not scientific, it needs to be explained how they can be informative about real world objects and events.  Popper's solution&lt;ref>Popper, Karl Raimund (1946) Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume XX.&lt;/ref> was an original contribution in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. His idea was that a number statement such as "2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples" can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and [[logical truth|logically true]], in the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Concisely, the pure mathematics "2 + 2 = 4" is always true, but, when the formula is applied to real world apples, it is open to falsification.&lt;ref>Gregory, Frank Hutson (1996) [[s:Arithmetic and Reality: A Development of Popper's Ideas|Arithmetic and Reality: A Development of Popper's Ideas]]. City University of Hong Kong. Republished in Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal No. 26 (December 2011).&lt;/ref>  ===Political philosophy=== {{Liberalism sidebar}} In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Popper developed a critique of [[historicism]] and a defence of the 'Open Society'. Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end. He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction. Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since "no society can predict, scientifically, its own future states of knowledge",{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} it follows, he argued, that there can be no predictive science of human history. For Popper, metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand. In ''After The Open Society'', which was published posthumously, a large collection of his previously unpublished and uncollected essays on social and political topics was assembled. In this, one can trace his ideas from material that pre-dated ''The Open Society'' to something that was completed just as he died.  In a 1992 lecture, Popper explained the connection between his political philosophy and his philosophy of science. As he stated, he was in his early years impressed by communism and also active in the Austrian Communist party. What had a profound effect on him was an event that happened in 1919: during a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several people, including some of Popper's friends. When Popper later told the leaders of the Communist party about this, they responded by stating that this loss of life was necessary in working towards the inevitable workers' revolution. This statement did not convince Popper and he started to think about what kind of reasoning would justify such a statement. He later concluded that there could not be any justification for it, and this was the start of his later criticism of historicism.  In 1947, Popper founded with [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and others the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] to defend [[classical liberalism]], in the spirit of the Open Society.  ====The paradox of tolerance==== {{Main|Paradox of tolerance}} Although Popper was an advocate of toleration, he said that intolerance should not be tolerated, for if tolerance allowed intolerance to succeed completely, tolerance itself would be threatened. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', he argued:  {{quote|Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.{{cite quote|date=March 2012}}}}  The utterance of intolerant philosophies should not always be suppressed, "as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion."{{cite quote|date=March 2012}} However:  {{quote|we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.{{cite quote|date=March 2012}}}}  Furthermore, in support of [[human rights]] legislation in the second half of the 20th century, he stated:  {{quote|We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.&lt;ref>''The Open Society and Its Enemies: The Spell of Plato'', by Karl Raimund Popper, Princeton University Press, 1971, ISBN 0-691-01968-1, pg 265&lt;/ref>}}  ===Metaphysics=== ====Truth==== As early as 1934, Popper wrote of the search for truth as "one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery."{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticised notion of [[Correspondence theory of truth|truth as correspondence]]. Then came the [[semantic theory of truth]] formulated by the logician [[Alfred Tarski]] and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to [[truth]] as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support [[metaphysical realism]] and the regulative idea of a search for truth.  According to this theory, the conditions for the truth of a sentence as well as the sentences themselves are part of a [[metalanguage]]. So, for example, the sentence "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Although many philosophers have interpreted, and continue to interpret, Tarski's theory as a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary theory]], Popper refers to it as a theory in which "is true" is replaced with "[[correspondence theory|corresponds to the facts]]". He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and the facts to which they refer. He identifies Tarski's formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a "metalinguistic predicate" and distinguishes the following cases:  # "John called" is true. # "It is true that John called."  The first case belongs to the metalanguage whereas the second is more likely to belong to the object language. Hence, "it is true that" possesses the logical status of a redundancy. "Is true", on the other hand, is a predicate necessary for making general observations such as "John was telling the truth about Phillip."  Upon this basis, along with that of the logical content of assertions (where logical content is inversely proportional to probability), Popper went on to develop his important notion of [[verisimilitude]] or "truthlikeness". The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply. And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasises forcefully, has nothing to do with "subjective probabilities" or other merely "epistemic" considerations.  The simplest mathematical formulation that Popper gives of this concept can be found in the tenth chapter of ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''. Here he defines it as:  : &lt;math>\mathit{Vs}(a)=\mathit{CT}_v(a)-\mathit{CT}_f(a) \,&lt;/math>  where &lt;math>\mathit{Vs}(a)&lt;/math> is the verisimilitude of ''a'', &lt;math>\mathit{CT}_v(a)&lt;/math> is a measure of the content of truth of ''a'', and &lt;math>\mathit{CT}_f(a)&lt;/math> is a measure of the content of the falsity of ''a''.  Popper's original attempt to define not just verisimilitude, but an actual measure on it, turned out to be inadequate. However, it inspired a wealth of new attempts.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthlikeness/ |title=Truthlikeness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref>  ====Cosmological pluralism==== {{main|Popperian cosmology}} Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972). He proposed [[Popper's three worlds|three worlds]]:&lt;ref>Karl Popper, Three Worlds, The Tanner Lecture on Human Values, The University of Michigan, 1978.&lt;/ref>  World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers{{Who|date=July 2012}} have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to [[Cartesian dualism]].  ====Origin and evolution of life==== The [[creationâ€“evolution controversy]] in the United States raises the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science and whether evolution itself may be legitimately called science. In the debate, both sides and even courts in their decisions have frequently invoked Popper's criterion of falsifiability. In this context, passages written by Popper are frequently quoted in which he speaks about such issues himself. For example, he famously stated "[[Darwinism]] is not a testable scientific theory, but a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] research program â€” a possible framework for testable scientific theories." He continued:  {{quote|And yet, the theory is invaluable. I do not see how, without it, our knowledge could have grown as it has done since Darwin. In trying to explain experiments with bacteria which become adapted to, say, penicillin, it is quite clear that we are greatly helped by the theory of natural selection. Although it is metaphysical, it sheds much light upon very concrete and very practical researches. It allows us to study adaptation to a new environment (such as a penicillin-infested environment) in a rational way: it suggests the existence of a mechanism of adaptation, and it allows us even to study in detail the mechanism at work.&lt;ref>''Unended Quest'' ch. 37 â€“ see Bibliography&lt;/ref>}}  He also noted that [[theism]], presented as explaining adaptation, "was worse than an open admission of failure, for it created the impression that an ultimate explanation had been reached."&lt;ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"> {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA211_1.html |title=CA211.1: Popper on natural selection's testability |publisher=[[talk.origins]] |accessdate=2009-05-26 |date=2005-11-02 |last= |first= }} &lt;/ref>  Popper later said:  {{quote|When speaking here of Darwinism, I shall speak always of today's theory â€“ that is Darwin's own theory of natural selection supported by the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian theory of heredity]], by the theory of the mutation and recombination of genes in a gene pool, and by the decoded genetic code. This is an immensely impressive and powerful theory. The claim that it completely explains evolution is of course a bold claim, and very far from being established. All scientific theories are conjectures, even those that have successfully passed many severe and varied tests. The Mendelian underpinning of modern Darwinism has been well tested, and so has the theory of evolution which says that all terrestrial life has evolved from a few primitive unicellular organisms, possibly even from one single organism.&lt;ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}}  He explained that the difficulty of testing had led some people to describe natural selection as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], and that he too had in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological', and had tried to explain how the theory could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest:  {{quote|My solution was that the doctrine of natural selection is a most successful metaphysical research programme. It raises detailed problems in many fields, and it tells us what we would expect of an acceptable solution of these problems. I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.&lt;ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}}  Popper summarized his new view as follows:  {{quote|The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true. There seem to be exceptions, as with so many biological theories; and considering the random character of the variations on which natural selection operates, the occurrence of exceptions is not surprising. Thus not all phenomena of evolution are explained by natural selection alone. Yet in every particular case it is a challenging research program to show how far natural selection can possibly be held responsible for the evolution of a particular organ or behavioral program.&lt;ref>Karl Popper in ''Evolutionary epistemology, rationality, and the sociology of knowledge'' by Radnitzky, Bartley and Popper, pp. 144â€“145, accessible at [http://books.google.com/books?id=QnFiTrCzg5oC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=The+theory+of+natural+selection+may+so+be+formulated+that+is+far+from+tautological.+In+this+case+it+is+not+only+testable,+but+it+turns+out+to+be+not+strictly+universally+true.+There+seems+to+be+exceptions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6I8kTZOgEIPCcfHx6LkB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20theory%20of%20natural%20selection%20may%20so%20be%20formulated%20that%20is%20far%20from%20tautological.%20In%20this%20case%20it%20is%20not%20only%20testable%2C%20but%20it%20turns%20out%20to%20be%20not%20strictly%20universally%20true.%20There%20seems%20to%20be%20exceptions&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref> }}  These frequently quoted passages are only a very small part of what Popper wrote on the issue of evolution, however, and give the wrong impression that he mainly discussed questions of its falsifiability. Popper never invented this criterion to give justifiable use of words like science. In fact, Popper says at the beginning of ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that it is not his aim to define science, and that science can in fact be defined quite arbitrarily.  Popper had his own sophisticated views on evolution that go much beyond what the frequently-quoted passages say.&lt;ref>''Objective Knowledge'', section "The Hopeful Behavioral Monster"&lt;/ref> In effect, Popper agreed with some of the points of both creationists and naturalists, but also disagreed with both views on crucial aspects. Popper understood the universe as a creative entity that invents new things, including life, but without the necessity of something like a god, especially not one who is pulling strings from behind the curtain. He said that evolution must, as the creationists say, work in a goal-directed way&lt;ref>D. W. Miller: Karl Popper, a scientific memoir. ''Out of Error'', p. 33&lt;/ref> but disagreed with their view that it must necessarily be the hand of god that imposes these goals onto the stage of life.  Instead, he formulated the spearhead model of evolution, a version of genetic pluralism. According to this model, living organisms themselves have goals, and act according to these goals, each guided by a central control. In its most sophisticated form, this is the brain of humans, but controls also exist in much less sophisticated ways for species of lower complexity, such as the [[amoeba]]. This control organ plays a special role in evolution â€“ it is the "spearhead of evolution". The goals bring the purpose into the world. Mutations in the genes that determine the structure of the control may then cause drastic changes in behaviour, preferences and goals, without having an impact on the organism's [[phenotype]]. Popper postulates that such purely behavioural changes are less likely to be lethal for the organism compared to drastic changes of the phenotype. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012|reason=for whole paragraph}}  Popper contrasts his views with the notion of the "hopeful monster" that has large phenotype mutations and calls it the "hopeful behavioural monster". After behaviour has changed radically, small but quick changes of the phenotype follow to make the organism fitter to its changed goals. This way it looks as if the phenotype were changing guided by some invisible hand, while it is merely natural selection working in combination with the new behaviour. For example, according to this hypothesis, the eating habits of the giraffe must have changed before its elongated neck evolved. Popper contrasted this view as evolution from within or active Darwinism (the organism actively trying to discover new ways of life and being on a quest for conquering new ecological niches), with the naturalistic evolution from without (which has the picture of a hostile environment only trying to kill the mostly passive organism, or perhaps segregate some of its groups).  Popper was a key figure encouraging patent lawyer [[GÃ¼nter WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user]] to publish his [[Ironâ€“sulfur world theory]] on [[abiogenesis]] and his criticism of "soup" theory.  ====Free will==== Popper and [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] speculated on the problem of [[free will]] for many years generally agreeing on an [[Interactionist dualism|interactionist dualist]] theory of mind. However, although Popper was a body-mind dualist, he did not think that the mind is [[substance dualism|a substance separate from the body]]: he thought that mental or psychological properties or aspects of people [[property dualism|are distinct from physical ones]].&lt;ref>Popper, K. R. "Of Clouds and Clocks," in his Objective Knowledge, corrected edition, pp. 206â€“55, Oxford, Oxford University Press (1973), p. 231 footnote 43, &amp; p. 252; also Popper, K. R. ''[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/popper/natural_selection_and_the_emergence_of_mind.html â€œNatural Selection and the Emergence of Mindâ€?]''1977.&lt;/ref>  When he gave the second [[Arthur Holly Compton]] Memorial Lecture in 1965, Popper revisited the idea of [[quantum indeterminacy]] as a source of human freedom. Eccles had suggested that "critically poised neurons" might be influenced by the mind to assist in a decision. Popper criticised Compton's idea of amplified quantum events affecting the decision. He wrote:  {{quote|The idea that the only alternative to determinism is just sheer chance was taken over by [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]], together with many of his views on the subject, from [[David Hume|Hume]], who asserted that 'the removal' of what he called 'physical necessity' must always result in 'the same thing with ''chance''. As objects must either be conjoin'd or not,... 'tis impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute necessity'.}}  {{quote|I shall later argue against this important doctrine according to which the alternative to determinism is sheer chance. Yet I must admit that the doctrine seems to hold good for the quantum-theoretical models which have been designed to explain, or at least to illustrate, the possibility of human freedom. This seems to be the reason why these models are so very unsatisfactory.&lt;ref>Popper, K. R. "Of Clouds and Clocks," in: ''Objective Knowledge'', corrected edition, pp. 227, Oxford, Oxford University Press (1973). Popper's Hume quote is from ''Treatise on Human Understanding'', (see note 8) Book I, Part I, Section XIV, p.171&lt;/ref>}}  {{quote|Hume's and Schlick's ontological thesis that there cannot exist anything intermediate between chance and determinism seems to me not only highly dogmatic (not to say doctrinaire) but clearly absurd; and it is understandable only on the assumption that they believed in a complete determinism in which chance has no status except as a symptom of our ignorance.&lt;ref>''Of Clouds and Clocks'', in ''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', Oxford (1972) p. 227ff.&lt;/ref>}}  Popper called not for something between chance and necessity but for a combination of randomness and control to explain freedom, though not yet explicitly in two stages with random chance before the controlled decision, saying, "freedom is not just chance but, rather, the result of a subtle interplay between something almost random or haphazard, and something like a restrictive or selective control."&lt;ref>''ibid'', p.232&lt;/ref>  Then in his 1977 book with John Eccles, ''The Self and its Brain'', Popper finally formulates the two-stage model in a temporal sequence. And he compares free will to Darwinian evolution and natural selection:  {{quote|New ideas have a striking similarity to genetic mutations. Now, let us look for a moment at genetic mutations. Mutations are, it seems, brought about by quantum theoretical indeterminacy (including radiation effects). Accordingly, they are also probabilistic and not in themselves originally selected or adequate, but on them there subsequently operates natural selection which eliminates inappropriate mutations. Now we could conceive of a similar process with respect to new ideas and to free-will decisions, and similar things.}}  {{quote|That is to say, a range of possibilities is brought about by a probabilistic and quantum mechanically characterised set of proposals, as it were â€“ of possibilities brought forward by the brain. On these there then operates a kind of selective procedure which eliminates those proposals and those possibilities which are not acceptable to the mind.&lt;ref>Eccles, John C. and Karl Popper.

''Skeptic'' '''6''':2 (1998)&lt;/ref> that Popper gave in 1969 with the condition that it shall be kept secret until after his death, he summarized his position on God as follows: "I don't know whether God exists or not. ... Some forms of atheism are arrogant and ignorant and should be rejected, but [[agnosticism]]â€”to admit that we don't know and to searchâ€”is all right. ... When I look at what I call the gift of life, I feel a gratitude which is in tune with some religious ideas of God. However, the moment I even speak of it, I am embarrassed that I may do something wrong to God in talking about God." He objected to organised religion, saying "it tends to use the name of God in vain", noting the danger of fanaticism because of religious conflicts: "The whole thing goes back to myths which, though they may have a kernel of truth, are untrue. Why then should the Jewish myth be true and the Indian and Egyptian myths not be true?" In a letter unrelated to the interview, he stressed his tolerant attitude: "Although I am not for religion, I do think that we should show respect for anybody who believes honestly."&lt;ref name=frs/>&lt;ref>Popper archives fasc. 297.11&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>See also Karl Popper: On freedom. ''All life is problem solving'' (1999), chapter 7, p. 81f&lt;/ref>  ==Influence== [[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|left|thumb|Sir Karl Popper in 1990]] Popper played a vital role in establishing the [[philosophy of science]] as a vigorous, autonomous discipline within [[analytic philosophy]], through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students. Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] and there lectured and influenced both [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science. (Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position, and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.)  While there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Popper had a long-standing and close friendship with economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], who was also brought to the London School of Economics from Vienna. Each found support and similarities in the other's work, citing each other often, though not without qualification. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, "I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]."&lt;ref>Hacohen, 2000&lt;/ref> Popper dedicated his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper, and in 1982 said, "...ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology."&lt;ref>Weimer and Palermo, 1982&lt;/ref>  Popper also had long and mutually influential friendships with art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]], biologist [[Peter Medawar]], and neuro-scientist [[John Carew Eccles]].  Popper's influence, both through his work in philosophy of science and through his political philosophy, has also extended beyond the academy. One of Popper's students at the London School of Economics was the billionaire investor [[George Soros]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} among whose [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] foundations is the [[Open Society Institute]], a think-tank named in honor of Popper's ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  Popperian philosophy also inspired the creation of [[Taking Children Seriously]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] movement which noticed that Popper's general theory of knowledge creation does not differentiate between adults and children.  ==Criticism== ===Philosophy of science=== Most criticisms of Popper's philosophy are of the falsification, or error elimination, element in his account of problem solving. It is intended as an ideal, practical method of effective human problem solving; as such, the current conclusions of science are stronger than pseudo-sciences or non-sciences, insofar as they have survived this particularly vigorous selection method. He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true, or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  Rather, it is a recommended ideal method that, if enacted by a system or community, will over time lead to slow but steady progress of a sort (relative to how well the system or community enacts the method). It has been suggested that Popper's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as [[logical positivism]], the followers of which mistook his aims for their own.&lt;ref>Bryan Magee 1973: Popper (Modern Masters series)&lt;/ref>  The [[confirmation holism|Quine-Duhem thesis]] argues that it's impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet [[Neptune]]: when the motion of [[Uranus]] was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory "There are seven planets in the solar system" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of [[Falsifiability#NaÃ¯ve|naÃ¯ve falsificationism]] in Chapters 3 &amp; 4 of ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific "the solar system has seven planets".{{Dubious|date=February 2010|reason=I just rechecked the mentioned chapters 3â€“4 of 'Logic of Scientific Discovery', and they don't appear to say any of this, or its equivalent â€“ quotations, please, if that is disagreed â€“ see talk.}}  [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' argued that scientists work in a series of [[paradigm]]s, and that falsificationist methodologies would make science impossible:  {{quote|No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of 'improbability' or of 'degree of falsification.' In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories [that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress]&lt;ref>{{Cite book | author=Kuhn, Thomas | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | year=1970 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | isbn= }}&lt;/ref>|}}  Popper's student [[Imre Lakatos]] attempted to reconcile Kuhn's work with [[falsificationism]] by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific [[universal quantification|universal statements]] of naÃ¯ve falsificationism. Another of Popper's students [[Paul Feyerabend]] ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology, and argued that the only universal method characterising scientific progress was ''anything goes''.  Popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his ''Logic of Discovery'' a fact later stressed by Kuhn, "that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about 'normal science'.&lt;ref>'K R Popper (1970)', "Normal Science and its Dangers", pages 51â€“58 in [[#refcgk1970|I Lakatos &amp; A Musgrave (eds.) (1970)]], at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA51 page 51].&lt;/ref> (But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.&lt;ref>'K R Popper (1970)', in I Lakatos &amp; A Musgrave (eds.) (1970), at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA56 page 56].&lt;/ref>) Also, in his collection ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (Harper &amp; Row, 1963), Popper writes, "Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them."  Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using [[statistical significance|statistical]] criteria to evaluate a [[null hypothesis]]. More generally it is not always clear, if evidence contradicts a hypothesis, that this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis rather than of flaws in the evidence. However, this is a misunderstanding of what Popper's philosophy of science sets out to do. Rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, Popper makes it clear in ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case.&lt;ref name="LdF">Popper, Karl, (1934) ''Logik der Forschung'', Springer. Vienna. Amplified English edition, Popper (1959), ISBN 0-415-27844-9&lt;/ref>  Popper's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like "for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt." The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, [[atomic theory]] implies that all metals melt at some temperature.  An early adversary of so-called critical rationalism, [[Karl-Otto Apel]] attempted a comprehensive refutation of Popper's philosophy. In ''Transformation der Philosophie'' (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.&lt;ref>See: "Apel, Karl-Otto," ''La philosophie de A a Z'', by Elizabeth Clement, Chantal Demonque, Laurence Hansen-Love, and Pierre Kahn, Paris, 1994, Hatier, 19â€“20.

Selz himself never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of [[Nazism]] which forced him to quit his work in 1933, and the prohibition of referring to Selz' work. Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticised in some academic quarters, for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx.&lt;ref>See: "Popper is committing a serious historical error in attributing the organic theory of the state to Plato and accusing him of all the fallacies of post-Hegelian and Marxist historicismâ€”the theory that history is controlled by the inexorable laws governing the behavior of superindividual social entities of which human beings and their free choices are merely subordinate manifestations."

''In Defense of Plato'', by [[Ronald B. Levinson]], New York, 1970, Russell and Russell, 20.&lt;/ref>  According to [[John N. Gray]], Popper held that "a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable, and should be given up as soon as it is falsified."&lt;ref>John Gray, Straw Dogs, p.22 Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref> By applying Popper's account of scientific method, Gray's ''Straw Dogs'' states that this would have "killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth." When they were first advanced, Gray claims, each of them was "at odds with some available evidence; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support."&lt;ref>John Gray, Straw Dogs, Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref> Against this, Gray seeks to establish the [[Irrationalist#Irrationalist|irrationalist]] thesis that "the progress of science comes from acting against reason."&lt;ref>John Gray, Straw Dogs, p.22, Granta Books, London, 2002&lt;/ref>  Gray does not, however, give any indication of what available evidence these theories were at odds with, and his appeal to "crucial support" illustrates the very [[Inductivism|inductivist]] approach to science that Popper sought to show was logically illegitimate. For, according to Popper, Einstein's theory was at least equally as well corroborated as Newton's upon its initial conception; they both equally well accounted for all the hitherto available evidence. Moreover, since Einstein also explained the empirical refutations of Newton's theory, general relativity was immediately deemed suitable for tentative acceptance on the Popperian account.&lt;ref>Karl Popper, Replies to my Critics, Open Court, London, 1974&lt;/ref> Indeed, Popper wrote, several decades before Gray's criticism, in reply to a critical essay by [[Imre Lakatos]]:  {{quote|It is true that I have used the terms "elimination", and even "rejection" when discussing "refutation". But it is clear from my main discussion that these terms mean, when applied to a scientific theory, that it is eliminated as a contender for the truth- that is, refuted, but not necessarily abandoned. Moreover, I have often pointed out that any such refutation is fallible. It is a typical matter of conjecture and of risk-taking whether or not we accept a refutation and, furthermore, of whether we "abandon" a theory or, say, only modify it, or even stick to it, and try to find some alternative, and methodologically acceptable, way round the problem involved. That I do not conflate even admitted falsity with the need to abandon a theory may be seen from the fact that I have frequently pointed out, that Einstein regarded general relativity as false, yet as a better approximation to the truth than Newton's gravitational theory. He certainly did not "abandon" it.

Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[collection]], [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]], and [[Calculus|change]].  Mathematicians involved with solving problems outside of pure mathematics are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]].  The discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.  ==Education== Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students who pass are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].  ==Motivation== Mathematicians do research in fields such as [[logic]], [[set theory]], [[category theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[number theory]], [[analysis]], [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[dynamical systems]], [[combinatorics]], [[game theory]], [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[computation]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. These fields comprise both [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]] and establish links between the two. Some fields, such as the theory of dynamical systems, or game theory, are classified as applied mathematics due to the relationships they possess with physics, economics and the other sciences. Whether probability theory and statistics are of theoretical nature, applied nature, or both, is quite controversial among mathematicians. Other branches of mathematics, however, such as logic, number theory, category theory or set theory are accepted as part of pure mathematics, though they find application in other sciences (predominantly [[computer science]] and [[physics]]). Likewise, analysis, geometry and topology, although considered pure mathematics, find applications in theoretical physicsâ€”[[string theory]], for instance.  Though it is true that mathematics finds diverse applications in many areas of research, a mathematician does not determine the value of an idea by the diversity of its applications. Mathematics is interesting in its own right, and a substantial minority of mathematicians investigate the diversity of structures studied in ''mathematics itself''. However, among academic mathematics, the majority of mathematical papers published in the United States are written by academics outside of mathematics departments.  Furthermore, a mathematician is not someone who merely manipulates formulas, numbers or equationsâ€”the diversity of mathematics allows for research concerning how concepts in one area of mathematics can be used in other areas too. For instance, if one graphs a set of solutions of an equation in some higher dimensional space, he may ask about the geometric properties of the graph. Thus one can understand equations by a pure understanding of abstract [[topology]] or [[geometry]]â€”this idea is of importance in [[algebraic geometry]]. Similarly, a mathematician does not restrict his study of numbers to the [[integer]]s; rather he considers more abstract structures such as [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], and in particular [[number ring]]s in the context of [[algebraic number theory]]. This exemplifies the abstract nature of mathematics and how it is not restricted to questions one may ask in daily life.  In a different direction, mathematicians ask questions about space and transformations that are not restricted to geometric figures such as squares and circles. For instance, an active area of research in [[differential topology]] concerns itself with the ways one can "smooth" higher dimensional figures. In fact, whether one can smooth certain higher dimensional spheres was, until recently, an open problem â€” known as the smooth [[PoincarÃ© conjecture]]. Another aspect of mathematics, [[set-theoretic topology]] and [[point-set topology]], concerns objects of a different nature from objects in our universe, or in a higher dimensional analogue of our universe. These objects behave in a rather strange manner under deformations, and the properties they possess are completely different from those of objects in our universe. For instance, the "distance" between two points on such an object, may depend on the order in which you consider the pair of points. This is quite different from ordinary life, in which it is accepted that the straight line distance from person A to person B is the same as that between person B and person A.  Another aspect of mathematics, often referred to as "foundational mathematics", consists of the fields of [[logic]] and [[set theory]]. These explore various ideas regarding the ways one can prove certain claims. This theory is far more complex than it seems, in that the truth of a claim depends on the context in which the claim is made, unlike basic ideas in daily life where truth is absolute. In fact, although some claims may be true, it is impossible to prove or disprove them in rather natural contexts.  Category theory, another field within "foundational mathematics", is rooted on the abstract axiomatization of the definition of a "class of mathematical structures", referred to as a "category". A category intuitively consists of a collection of objects, and defined relationships between them. While these objects may be anything (such as "tables" or "chairs"), mathematicians are usually interested in particular, more abstract, classes of such objects. In any case, it is the ''relationships between these objects'', and ''not the actual objects'' that are predominantly studied.  == Occupations == According to the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] occupations in mathematics include the following.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://occupationalinfo.org/defset1_3829.html |title=020 OCCUPATIONS IN MATHEMATICS |work=Dictionary Of Occupational Titles |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref>  * Mathematician * Operations-Research Analyst * Mathematical Statistician * Mathematical Technician * Actuary * Applied Statistician * Weight Analyst  == Differences with scientists == Mathematics differs from [[natural science]] in that scientists subject [[truth claim]]s to tests by experiments, while mathematical [[proposition]]s are conclusions of [[mathematical proof]]s.  If a definite statement is believed plausible by some mathematicians but has been neither proved nor disproved, it is called a ''[[conjecture]]'', as opposed to an ultimate goal: a ''theorem'' that has been proved.  Scientific theories change when new information about the world is discovered. Mathematics changes in a similar way: New ideas do not falsify old ones, but new concepts refine old concepts and old theories, attaining a fuller understanding of the truth.  One method of refinement is [[generalization]], for example widening the scope of a concept. For instance, [[calculus]] (in one variable) generalizes to [[multivariable calculus]], which generalizes to analysis on [[manifold]]s. The development of [[algebraic geometry]] from its classical to modern forms is a particularly striking example of the way an area of mathematics can change radically in its viewpoint, without making what was correctly proved before in any way incorrect; of course mathematical progress clarifies gaps in previous proofs, often by exposing hidden assumptions, which progress has revealed worth conceptualizing.  A theorem is true, and was true before we knew it and will be true after humans are extinct. Of course, our understanding of what the theorem ''really means'' gains in profundity as the mathematics around the theorem grows. A mathematician feels that a theorem is better understood when it can be extended to apply in a broader setting than previously known. For instance, [[Fermat's little theorem]] for the nonzero integers modulo a prime generalizes to [[Euler's theorem]] for the invertible numbers modulo any nonzero integer, which generalizes to [[Lagrange theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] for finite groups.  == Women in mathematics == {{See also|List of female mathematicians}}  While the majority of mathematicians are male, there have been some demographic changes since [[World War II]]. Some prominent female mathematicians are [[Hypatia of Alexandria]] (ca. 400 AD), [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815â€“1852), [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]] (1718â€“1799), [[Emmy Noether]] (1882â€“1935), [[Sophie Germain]] (1776â€“1831), [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] (1850â€“1891), [[Alicia Boole Stott]] (1860â€“1940), [[RÃ³zsa PÃ©ter]] (1905â€“1977), [[Julia Robinson]] (1919â€“1985), [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] (1906â€“1995), [[Ã‰milie du ChÃ¢telet]] (1706â€“1749), [[Mary Cartwright]] (1900â€“1998), [[Olga Aleksandrovna Ladyzhenskaya|Olga Ladyzhenskaya]] (1922â€“2004), and [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik|Olga Oleinik]] (1925â€“2001).  The [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] is a professional society whose purpose is "to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences." The [[American Mathematical Society]] and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics.  == Prizes in mathematics == There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though sometimes mathematicians have won the Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the [[Abel Prize]], the [[Chern Medal]], the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Gauss Prize]], the [[Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[Crafoord Prize]],  the [[Shaw Prize]], the [[Steele Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[Schock Prize]], and the [[Nevanlinna Prize]].  == Quotations about mathematicians == {{Wikiquote}} The following are quotations about mathematicians, or by mathematicians.  : ''A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.'' ::â€”Attributed to both [[AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi]]&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html |title=Biography of AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref> and [[Paul ErdÅ‘s]]  : ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so Ã¼bersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.''

There are only four such algebras, the other three being the [[real number]]s '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', and the [[quaternion]]s '''H'''. The octonions are the largest such algebra, with eight dimensions, double the number of the quaternions from which they are an extension. They are [[commutative property|noncommutative]] and [[associative property|nonassociative]], but satisfy a weaker form of associativity, namely they are [[alternative algebra|alternative]].  Octonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used. Despite this they have some interesting properties and are related to a number of exceptional structures in mathematics, among them the [[Simple Lie group#Exceptional cases|exceptional Lie group]]s. Additionally, octonions have applications in fields such as [[string theory]], [[special relativity]], and [[quantum logic]].  The octonions were discovered in 1843 by [[John T. Graves]], inspired by his friend [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]]'s discovery of quaternions. Graves called his discovery '''octaves'''. They were discovered independently by [[Arthur Cayley]]&lt;ref>{{harvs|txt|first=Arthur |last=Cayley|authorlink=Arthur Cayley|year=1845}}&lt;/ref> and are sometimes referred to as '''Cayley numbers''' or the '''Cayley algebra'''.  == Definition ==  The octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of real numbers. Every octonion is a real [[linear combination]] of the '''unit octonions''':  :&lt;math>\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\},\,&lt;/math>  where ''e''&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub> is the scalar or real element; it may be identified with the real number 1. That is, every octonion ''x'' can be written in the form :&lt;math>x = x_0e_0 + x_1e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 + x_4e_4 + x_5e_5 + x_6e_6 + x_7e_7,\,&lt;/math> with real coefficients {''x''&lt;sub>''i''&lt;/sub>}.  Addition and subtraction of octonions is done by adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their coefficients, like quaternions. Multiplication is more complex. Multiplication is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition, so the product of two octonions can be calculated by summing the product of all the terms, again like quaternions. The product of each term can be given by multiplication of the coefficients and a [[multiplication table]] of the unit octonions, like this one:&lt;ref name=Cayley>  This table is due to [[Arthur Cayley]] (1845) and [[John T. Graves]] (1843).

Just as quaternions can be defined as pairs of complex numbers, the octonions can be defined as pairs of quaternions. Addition is defined pairwise. The product of two pairs of quaternions (''a'', ''b'') and (''c'', ''d'') is defined by :&lt;math>\ (a,b)(c,d)=(ac-d^{*}b,da+bc^{*})&lt;/math> where &lt;math>z^{*}&lt;/math> denotes the [[Quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocal|conjugate of the quaternion]] ''z''. This definition is equivalent to the one given above when the eight unit octonions are identified with the pairs :(1,0), (''i'',0), (''j'',0), (''k'',0), (0,1), (0,''i''), (0,''j''), (0,''k'')  ===Fano plane mnemonic=== [[File:FanoMnemonic.PNG|thumb|A mnemonic for the products of the unit octonions.&lt;ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=p. 6}}&lt;/ref>]] A convenient [[mnemonic]] for remembering the products of unit octonions is given by the diagram at the right, which represents the multiplication table of Cayley and Graves.&lt;ref name=Cayley>  [[Arthur Cayley]] (1845) and [[John T.

The lines are oriented. The seven points correspond to the seven standard basis elements of Im('''O''') (see definition [[#Conjugate, norm, and inverse|below]]). Each pair of distinct points lies on a unique line and each line runs through exactly three points.  Let (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow. Then multiplication is given by :''ab'' = ''c'' and ''ba'' = âˆ’''c'' together with [[cyclic permutation]]s. These rules together with *1 is the multiplicative identity, *''e''&lt;sub>''i''&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> = âˆ’1 for each point in the diagram completely defines the multiplicative structure of the octonions. Each of the seven lines generates a subalgebra of '''O''' isomorphic to the quaternions '''H'''.  ===Conjugate, norm, and inverse=== The ''conjugate'' of an octonion :&lt;math>x = x_0\,e_0 + x_1\,e_1 + x_2\,e_2 + x_3\,e_3 + x_4\,e_4 + x_5\,e_5 + x_6\,e_6 + x_7\,e_7&lt;/math> is given by :&lt;math>x^* = x_0\,e_0 - x_1\,e_1 - x_2\,e_2 - x_3\,e_3 - x_4\,e_4 - x_5\,e_5 - x_6\,e_6 - x_7\,e_7.&lt;/math> Conjugation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of '''O''' and satisfies ''(xy)''*=''y''* ''x''* (note the change in order).  The ''real part'' of ''x'' is given by :&lt;math>\frac{x + x^*}{2} = x_0\,e_0&lt;/math> and the ''imaginary part'' by :&lt;math>\frac{x - x^*}{2} = x_1\,e_1 + x_2\,e_2 + x_3\,e_3 + x_4\,e_4 + x_5\,e_5 + x_6\,e_6 + x_7\,e_7.&lt;/math>  The set of all purely imaginary octonions span a 7 dimension subspace of '''O''', denoted Im('''O''').  Conjugation of octonions satisfies the equation : &lt;math>x^* =-\frac{1}{6} (x+(e_1x)e_1+(e_2x)e_2+(e_3x)e_3+(e_4x)e_4+(e_5x)e_5+(e_6x)e_6+(e_7x)e_7).&lt;/math>  The product of an octonion with its conjugate, ''x''* ''x'' = ''x'' ''x''*, is always a nonnegative real number:  :&lt;math>x^*x = x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2.&lt;/math>  Using this the norm of an octonion can be defined, as  :&lt;math>\|x\| = \sqrt{x^*x}.&lt;/math>  This norm agrees with the standard [[Euclidean norm]] on '''R'''&lt;sup>8&lt;/sup>.  The existence of a norm on '''O''' implies the existence of [[inverse element|inverses]] for every nonzero element of '''O'''. The inverse of ''x'' â‰  0 is given by :&lt;math>x^{-1} = \frac {x^*}{\|x\|^2}.&lt;/math> It satisfies ''x'' ''x''&lt;sup>âˆ’1&lt;/sup> = ''x''&lt;sup>âˆ’1&lt;/sup> ''x'' = 1.  == Properties == Octonionic multiplication is neither [[commutative]]: :&lt;math>e_ie_j = -e_je_i \neq e_je_i\,&lt;/math> if &lt;math>i, j \neq 0&lt;/math> nor [[associative]]: :&lt;math>(e_ie_j)e_k = -e_i(e_je_k) \neq e_i(e_je_k)\,&lt;/math> if &lt;math>i, j, k \neq 0&lt;/math> The octonions do satisfy a weaker form of associativity: they are [[alternative algebra|alternative]]. This means that the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is [[associative]]. Actually, one can show that the subalgebra generated by any two elements of '''O''' is [[isomorphic]] to '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''', all of which are associative. Because of their non-associativity, octonions don't have matrix representations, unlike [[quaternions]].  The octonions do retain one important property shared by '''R''', '''C''', and '''H''': the norm on '''O''' satisfies :&lt;math>\|xy\| = \|x\|\|y\|&lt;/math> This implies that the octonions form a nonassociative [[normed division algebra]]. The higher-dimensional algebras defined by the [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]] (e.g. the [[sedenion]]s) all fail to satisfy this property. They all have [[zero divisor]]s.  Wider number systems exist which have a multiplicative modulus (e.g. 16 dimensional conic [[sedenion]]s). Their modulus is defined differently from their norm, and they also contain [[zero divisor]]s.  It turns out that the only normed division algebras over the reals are '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. These four algebras also form the only alternative, finite-dimensional [[division algebra]]s over the reals ([[up to]] isomorphism).  Not being associative, the nonzero elements of '''O''' do not form a group. They do, however, form a [[loop (algebra)|loop]], indeed a [[Moufang loop]].  ===Commutator and cross product=== The [[commutator]] of two octonions ''x'' and ''y'' is given by  :&lt;math>[x, y] = xy - yx.\,&lt;/math>  This is antisymmetric and imaginary. If it is considered only as a product on the imaginary subspace Im('''O''') it defines a product on that space, the [[seven-dimensional cross product]], given by  :&lt;math>x \times y = \frac{1}{2}(xy - yx).&lt;/math>  Like the [[cross product]] in three dimensions this is a vector orthogonal to ''x'' and ''y'' with magnitude  :&lt;math>\|x \times y\| = \|x\| \|y\| \sin \theta.&lt;/math>  But like the octonion product it is not uniquely defined. Instead there are many different cross products, each one dependent on the choice of octonion product.&lt;ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=pp. 37â€“38}}&lt;/ref>  ===Automorphisms=== An [[automorphism]], ''A'', of the octonions is an invertible [[linear transformation]] of '''O''' which satisfies :&lt;math>A(xy) = A(x)A(y).\,&lt;/math> The set of all automorphisms of '''O''' forms a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] called [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>]]. The group ''G''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> is a [[simply connected]], [[Compact group|compact]], real [[Lie group]] of dimension 14. This group is the smallest of the [[exceptional Lie group]]s and is isomorphic to the subgroup of Spin(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional real spinor representation.

The work may be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish; and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Although generally considered essential to academic quality, and used in most important scientific publications, peer review has been [[Peer review#Criticisms|criticized]] as ineffective, slow, and misunderstood (also see [[anonymous peer review]] and [[open peer review]]). Other critiques of the current peer review process from concerned scholars has stemmed from [[Soon and Baliunas controversy|recent controversial studies]] published by the [[Harvardâ€“Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and NASA.&lt;ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2276919/ The NASA study of arsenic-based life was fatally flawed, say scientists. â€“ Slate Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title -->]&lt;/ref> These two published articles are now case studies of [[peer review failure]].

This process encourages authors to meet the accepted [[Norm (sociology)|standards]] of their discipline and prevents the dissemination of irrelevant findings, unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Publications that have not undergone peer review are likely to be regarded with suspicion by scholars and professionals.  ===Justification=== [[File:Easy Peer Review Gadget In Persian Wikinews.png|thumb|right|220px|Easy peer review gadget in Persian Wikinews]]  It is difficult for authors and researchers, whether individually or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated piece of work. This is not necessarily a reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply looks at it with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial.&lt;ref name=fire/>&lt;ref name=sims/>  Furthermore, the decision whether or not to publish a scholarly article, or what should be modified before publication, lies with the editor of the journal to which the manuscript has been submitted. Similarly, the decision whether or not to fund a proposed project rests with an official of the funding agency. These individuals usually refer to the opinion of one or more reviewers in making their decision. This is primarily for three reasons: * Workload. A small group of editors/assessors cannot devote sufficient time to each of the many articles submitted to many journals. * Diversity of opinion. Were the editor/assessor to judge all submitted material themselves, approved material would solely reflect their opinion. * Limited expertise. An editor/assessor cannot be expected to be sufficiently expert in all areas covered by a single journal or funding agency to adequately judge all submitted material. Thus it is normal for manuscripts and grant proposals to be sent to one or more external reviewers for comment.  Reviewers are typically [[anonymity|anonymous]] and [[independence|independent]], to help foster unvarnished criticism, and to discourage [[cronyism]] in funding and publication decisions. However, US government guidelines governing peer review for federal regulatory agencies require that reviewer's identity be disclosed under some circumstances. Anonymity may be unilateral or reciprocal (single- or double-blinded reviewing).  Since reviewers are normally selected from experts in the fields discussed in the article, the process of peer review is considered critical to establishing a reliable body of research and knowledge. Scholars reading the published articles can only be expert in a limited area; they rely, to some degree, on the peer-review process to provide reliable and credible research that they can build upon for subsequent or related research. As a result, significant scandal ensues when an author is found to have falsified the research included in an article, as many other scholars, and the field of study itself, may have relied upon the original research.  ===Procedure=== In the case of proposed publications, an editor sends advance copies of an author's work or [[idea]]s to researchers or scholars who are [[expert]]s in the field (known as "referees" or "reviewers"), nowadays normally by e-mail or through a web-based manuscript processing system. Usually, there are two or three referees for a given article.  These referees each return an evaluation of the work to the editor, noting weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. Typically, most of the referees' comments are eventually seen by the author; [[scientific journal]]s observe this convention universally. The editor, usually familiar with the field of the manuscript (although typically not in as much depth as the referees, who are specialists), then evaluates the referees' comments, her or his own opinion of the manuscript, and the context of the scope of the journal or level of the book and readership, before passing a decision back to the author(s), usually with the referees' comments.  Referees' evaluations usually include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript or proposal, often chosen from options provided by the journal or funding agency. Most recommendations are along the lines of the following: * to unconditionally accept the manuscript or proposal, * to accept it in the event that its authors improve it in certain ways, * to reject it, but encourage revision and invite resubmission, * to reject it outright.  During this process, the role of the referees is advisory, and the editor is typically under no formal obligation to accept the opinions of the referees. Furthermore, in scientific publication, the referees do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve [[consensus]]. Thus the group dynamics are substantially different from that of a jury.  In situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of a work, there are a number of strategies for reaching a decision. When an editor receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the editor often will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As another strategy in the case of ties, editors may invite authors to reply to a referee's [[criticism]]s and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If an editor does not feel confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the editor may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, an editor will convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, editors do not allow referees to confer with each other, though the reviewer may see earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions. Some medical journals, however (usually following the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] model), have begun posting on the Internet the pre-publication history of each individual article, from the original submission to reviewers' reports, authors' comments, and revised manuscripts.  Traditionally, reviewers would remain anonymous to the authors, but this standard is slowly changing. In some academic fields, most journals now offer the reviewer the option of remaining anonymous or not, or a referee may opt to sign a review, thereby relinquishing anonymity. Published papers sometimes contain, in the acknowledgments section, thanks to anonymous or named referees who helped improve the paper.  Most university presses undertake peer review of books. After positive review by two or three independent referees, a university press sends the manuscript to the press's editorial board, a committee of faculty members, for final approval.&lt;ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Arnold | first = Gordon B. | editor = James W.

To be admitted to speak, scholars and scientists must submit papers (generally short, often 15 pages or less) in advance. These papers are reviewed by a "program committee" (the equivalent of an editorial board), which generally requests inputs from referees. The hard deadlines set by the conferences tend to limit the options to either accepting or rejecting the paper.  ===Recruiting referees=== At a journal or book publisher, the task of picking reviewers typically falls to an [[editing|editor]].&lt;ref name="OGorman2008Frustrating">{{Cite journal | author = Lawrence O'Gorman | title = The (Frustrating) State of Peer Review | journal = IAPR Newsletter | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 3â€“5 | month = January | year = 2008 | url = http://iapr.org/docs/newsletter-2008-01.pdf }}&lt;/ref> When a manuscript arrives, an editor solicits reviews from scholars or other experts who may or may not have already expressed a willingness to referee for that [[academic journal|journal]] or book division. Granting agencies typically recruit a [[Committee|panel]] or [[committee]] of reviewers in advance of the arrival of applications.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1995PeerReviewProcess">{{Cite journal | author = Samuel M. Schwartz, Donald W. Slater, Fred P. Heydrick, and Gillian R.

Referees are supposed to inform the editor of any [[conflict of interests]] that might arise. Journals or individual editors often invite a manuscript's authors to name people whom they consider qualified to referee their work. Indeed, for a number of journals this is a requirement of submission. Authors are sometimes also invited to name natural candidates who should be ''disqualified'', in which case they may be asked to provide justification (typically expressed in terms of conflict of interest). In some disciplines, scholars listed in an "acknowledgments" section are not allowed to serve as referees (hence the occasional practice of using this section to disqualify potentially negative reviewers).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  Editors solicit author input in selecting referees because [[academia|academic]] writing typically is very specialized. Editors often oversee many specialties, and can not be experts in all of them. But after an editor selects referees from the pool of candidates, the editor typically is obliged not to disclose the referees' identities to the authors, and in scientific journals, to each other (see [[Anonymous peer review]]). Policies on such matters differ among academic disciplines.  Recruiting [[referee]]s is a political art, because referees, and often editors, are usually not paid, and reviewing takes time away from the referee's main activities, such as his or her own research. To the would-be recruiter's advantage, most potential referees are authors themselves, or at least readers, who know that the publication system requires that [[expert]]s donate their time. Referees also have the opportunity to prevent work that does not meet the standards of the field from being published, which is a position of some responsibility. Editors are at a special advantage in recruiting a scholar when they have overseen the publication of his or her work, or if the scholar is one who hopes to submit manuscripts to that editor's publication in the future. Granting agencies, similarly, tend to seek referees among their present or former grantees. Serving as a referee can even be a condition of a grant, or professional association membership.  Another difficulty that peer review organizers face is that, with respect to some manuscripts or proposals, there may be few scholars who truly qualify as experts. Such a circumstance often frustrates the goals of reviewer anonymity and the avoidance of conflicts of interest. It also increases the chances that an organizer will not be able to recruit true experts â€“ people who have themselves done work similar to that under review, and who can read between the lines. Low-prestige or local journals and granting agencies that award little money are especially handicapped with regard to recruiting experts.  Finally, [[anonymity]] adds to the difficulty in finding reviewers in another way. In scientific circles, [[credentials]] and [[reputation]] are important, and while being a referee for a prestigious journal is considered an honor, the anonymity restrictions make it impossible to publicly state that one was a referee for a particular article. However, credentials and reputation are principally established by publications, not by refereeing; and in some fields refereeing may not be anonymous.  ===Different styles of review=== In ""[[double-blind]]" review, the identity of the authors is concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa, lest the knowledge of authorship or concern about disapprobation from the author bias their review. Critics of the double-blind process point out that, despite the extra editorial effort to ensure anonymity, the process often fails to do so, since certain approaches, methods, writing styles, notations, etc., may point to a certain group of people in a research stream, and even to a particular person.&lt;ref>[http://blogs.nature.com/nn/actionpotential/2005/12/doubleblind_peer_review.html Action Potential: Double-blind peer review?&lt;!-- Bot generated title -->]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref> {{cite journal |title=Editorial: Working double-blind |journal=Nature |volume=451 |issue=7179 |pages=605â€“6 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18256621 |doi=10.1038/451605b |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/full/451605b.html}}&lt;/ref> Proponents of double-blind review argue that it performs at least as well as single-blind, and that it generates a better perception of fairness and equality in global scientific funding and publishing.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |author=Mainguy G, Motamedi MR, Mietchen D |title=Peer reviewâ€”the newcomers' perspective |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e326 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16149851 |pmc=1201308 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030326 }}&lt;/ref>  Proponents also argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the associate editor responsible for the paper can easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. Single-blind review is thus strongly dependent upon the goodwill of the participants.  A [[conflict of interest]] arises when a reviewer and author have a disproportionate amount of respect (or disrespect) for each other. As an alternative to single-blind and double-blind review, authors and reviewers are encouraged to declare their conflicts of interest when the names of authors and sometimes reviewers are known to the other. When conflicts are reported, the conflicting reviewer is prohibited from reviewing and discussing the manuscript. The incentive for reviewers to declare their conflicts of interest is a matter of professional ethics and individual integrity. While their reviews are not public, these reviews are a matter of record and the reviewer's credibility depends upon how they represent themselves among their peers. Some software engineering journals, such as the [[IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering]], use non-blind reviews with reporting to editors of conflicts of interest by both authors and reviewers.  A more rigorous standard of accountability is known as an audit. Because reviewers are not paid, they cannot be expected to put as much time and effort into a review as an audit requires. Therefore, [[academic journal]]s such as [[Science (journal)|Science]], organizations such as the or the [[American Geophysical Union]], and agencies such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] maintain and [[Scientific data archiving|archive scientific data and methods]] in the event another researcher wishes to replicate or audit the research after publication.&lt;ref name=sci-data> {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Policy on Referencing Data in and Archiving Data for AGU Publications | quote = The following policy has been adopted for AGU publications in order to ensure that they can effectively and efficiently perform an expanded role in making the underlying data for articles available to researchers now and in the future. | publisher = [[American Geophysical Union]] | year = 2012 | url = http://www.agu.org/pubs/authors/policies/data_policy.shtml | accessdate =2012-09-08}} *This policy was first adopted by the AGU Publications Committee in November 1993 and then revised March 1994, December 1995, October 1996. *See also AGU [http://library.ucar.edu/content/events/data_workshop/presentations/Cook_BridgingDataLifecyclesWorkshop.pdf Data Policy] by Bill Cook.

The reviewers do not know the author's identity, as any identifying information is stripped from the document before review. The system is intended to reduce or eliminate bias, although this has been challenged â€“ for example [[Eugene Koonin]], a senior investigator at the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], asserts that the system has "well-known ills"&lt;ref> [http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature05005.html Nature (2006)] | {{doi|10.1038/nature05005}}&lt;/ref> and advocates "[[open peer review]]".

The concept thus represents a departure from, and an alternative to, the incumbent [[anonymous peer review]] process, in which non-disclosure of these identities toward the public â€“ and toward the authors of the work under review â€“ is default practice. The open peer review concept appears to constitute a response to modern criticisms of the incumbent system; therefore, its emergence may be partially attributed to these phenomena.  ===Postpublication reviews=== The process of peer review does not end after a paper completes the peer review process. After being put to press, and after 'the ink is dry', the process of peer review continues as publications are read. Readers will often send [[Letter to the editor|letters to the editor]] of a journal, or correspond with the editor via an on-line journal club. In this way, all 'peers' may offer review and critique of published literature. A variation on this theme is [[open peer commentary]]; journals using this process solicit and publish non-anonymous commentaries on the "target paper" together with the paper, and with original authors' reply as a matter of course. The introduction of the "[[Electronic article|epub]] ahead of print" practice in many journals has made possible the simultaneous publication of unsolicited letters to the editor together with the original paper in the print issue.  ==Criticism of peer review== Drummond Rennie, deputy editor of ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' is an organizer of the International Congress on Peer Review and Biomedical Publication, which has been held every four years since 1986. He remarks, &lt;blockquote> There seems to be no study too fragmented, no hypothesis too trivial, no literature too biased or too egotistical, no design too warped, no methodology too bungled, no presentation of results too inaccurate, too obscure, and too contradictory, no analysis too self-serving, no argument too circular, no conclusions too trifling or too unjustified, and no grammar and syntax too offensive for a paper to end up in print.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |author=Rennie D, Flanagin A, Smith R, Smith J |title=Fifth International Congress on Peer Review and Biomedical Publication: Call for Research |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=11 |page=1438 |date=March 19, 2003 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/289/11/1438 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.11.1438}}&lt;/ref> &lt;/blockquote>  [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], editor of the British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', has said that &lt;blockquote> The mistake, of course, is to have thought that peer review was any more than a crude means of discovering the acceptabilityâ€”not the validityâ€”of a new finding. Editors and scientists alike insist on the pivotal importance of peer review. We portray peer review to the public as a quasi-sacred process that helps to make science our most objective truth teller. But we know that the system of peer review is biased, unjust, unaccountable, incomplete, easily fixed, often insulting, usually ignorant, occasionally foolish, and frequently wrong.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |author=Horton, Richard |title=Genetically modified food: consternation, confusion, and crack-up |journal=MJA |volume=172 |issue=4 |pages=148â€“9 |year=2000 |pmid=10772580 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/172_04_210200/horton/horton.html}}&lt;/ref> &lt;/blockquote>  ===Allegations of bias and suppression=== The interposition of editors and reviewers between authors and readers always raises the possibility that the intermediators may serve as [[gatekeepers]].&lt;ref>Bradley, (1981)&lt;/ref> Some [[Science and technology studies|sociologists of science]] argue that peer review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by [[elite]]s and to personal jealousy.&lt;ref>"[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-08/cu-bse081204.php British scientists exclude 'maverick' colleagues, says report]" (2004) EurekAlert Public release date: August 16, 2004&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web| last =Higgs| first =Robert| title =Peer Review, Publication in Top Journals, Scientific Consensus, and So Forth| publisher =Independent Institute| date =May 7, 2007| url =http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1963| accessdate =April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref> The peer review process may [[Suppression of dissent|suppress dissent]] against "[[mainstream]]" theories.&lt;ref>[[Brian Martin (professor)|Brian Martin]], "[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ Suppression Stories]" (1997) in ''Fund for Intellectual Dissent'' ISBN 0-646-30349-X&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>See also Juan Miguel Campanario, "[http://www2.uah.es/jmc/nobel.html Rejecting Nobel class articles and resisting Nobel class discoveries]", cited in ''Nature'', October 16, 2003, Vol 425, Issue 6959, p.645&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite journal |author=Campanario, Juan Miguel; Martin, Brian |title=Challenging dominant physics paradigms |journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=421â€“38 |month=Fall |year=2004 |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/04jse.html |bibcode=2008atcr.book...11C |last2=Martin}}&lt;/ref> Reviewers tend to be especially critical of conclusions that contradict their own [[Opinion|views]],&lt;ref>"... they may strongly resist a rival's hypothesis that challenges their own."

Starting in the 1990s, several scientific journals (including the high impact journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2006) started experiments with hybrid peer review processes, often allowing open peer reviews in parallel to the traditional model. The initial evidence of the effect of open peer review upon the quality of reviews, the tone and the time spent on reviewing was mixed, although it does seem that under open peer review, more of those who are invited to review decline to do so.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Effect of open peer review on quality of reviews and on reviewers' recommendations: a randomised trial |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7175 |page=23 |year= 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/318/7175/23 |pmid= 9872878 |last1= Van Rooyen |first1= S |last2= Godlee |first2= F |last3= Evans |first3= S |last4= Black |first4= N |last5= Smith |first5= R |pmc= 27670 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.318.7175.23 |pages= 23â€“7 }}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.47 | title = Open peer review: a randomised controlled trial | author = Elizabeth Walsh, Maeve Rooney, Louis Appleby, Greg Wilkinson | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 47â€“51 | journal = The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | year = 2000 | pmid = 10789326 }}&lt;/ref>  Throughout the 2000s first academic journals based solely on the concept of open peer review were launched (see e.g. ''[[Philica]]''). An extension of peer review beyond the date of publication is [[open peer commentary]], whereby expert commentaries are solicited on published articles, and the authors are encouraged to respond.  ==Peer review of government policy== The technique of peer review is also used to improve government policy. In particular, the [[European Union]] uses it as a tool in the 'Open Method of Co-ordination' of policies in the fields of employment and social inclusion.  A program of peer reviews in [[active labour market policy]]&lt;ref>[http://www.mutual-learning-employment.net/peer-reviews/ Mutual Learning Programme â€“ Peer Reviews]&lt;/ref> started in 1999, and was followed in 2004 by one in [[social inclusion]].&lt;ref>[http://www.peer-review-social-inclusion.net Peer Review and Assessment in Social Inclusionâ€”Evaluations par les pairs&lt;!-- Bot generated title -->]&lt;/ref> Each program sponsors about eight peer review meetings in each year, in which a 'host country' lays a given policy or initiative open to examination by half a dozen other countries and relevant European-level NGOs. These usually meet over two days and include visits to local sites where the policy can be seen in operation. The meeting is preceded by the compilation of an [[expert report]] on which participating 'peer countries' submit comments. The results are published on the web.  {{Further|U.S. Government peer review policies}}  ==History== The first recorded editorial prepublication peer-review process was at [[The Royal Society]] in 1665 by the founding editor of [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]], [[Henry Oldenburg]].&lt;ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1axrolCpkC&amp;pg=PA220 GoogleBooks]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/publication.html On Being a Scientist ''National Academies Press'']&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/13105/1/399we23.htm The Origin of the Scientific Journal and the Process of Peer Review ''House of Commons Select Committee Report'']&lt;/ref> In the 20th century, peer review became common for science funding allocations.

A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a [[composite number]]. For example, 5 is prime because only 1 and 5 evenly divide it, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] establishes the central role of primes in [[number theory]]: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique [[up to]] ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem [[#Primality of one|requires excluding]] 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many copies of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 &amp;times; 3, 1 &amp;times; 1 &amp;times; 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.  The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number ''n'' is known as [[trial division]]. It consists of testing whether ''n'' is a multiple of any integer between 2 and &lt;math>\sqrt{n}&lt;/math>. Algorithms that are much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as [[Mersenne number]]s. {{As of|2013|2}}, the [[largest known prime number]] has 17,425,170 [[numerical digit|decimal digits]].  There are [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] primes, as [[Euclid's theorem|demonstrated by Euclid]] around 300 BC. There is no known useful formula that sets apart all of the prime numbers from composites. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modeled. The first result in that direction is the [[prime number theorem]], proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the [[probability]] that a given, randomly chosen number {{math|''n''}} is prime is inversely [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its number of digits, or to the [[logarithm]] of ''n''.  Many questions around prime numbers remain open, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]], which proposes that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the [[twin prime]] conjecture, which says that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on [[analytic number theory|analytic]] or [[algebraic number theory|algebraic]] aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in [[information technology]], such as [[public-key cryptography]], which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of [[Integer factorization|factoring]] large numbers into their [[prime factor]]s. Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly [[algebra]], such as [[prime element]]s and [[prime ideal]]s.  ==Definition and examples== A [[natural number]] (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a '''prime''' or a '''prime number''' ''if'' it has exactly two positive [[divisor]]s, 1 and the number itself.&lt;ref>{{Citation | last1=Dudley| first1=Underwood | title=Elementary number theory | publisher=W.

Therefore the number 11 is a prime.]] Among the numbers 1 to 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, while 1, 4, and 6 are not prime. 1 is excluded as a prime number, for reasons explained below. 2 is a prime number, since the only natural numbers dividing it are 1 and 2. Next, 3 is prime, too: 1 and 3 do divide 3 without remainder, but 3 divided by 2 gives [[remainder]] 1. Thus, 3 is prime. However, 4 is composite, since 2 is another number (in addition to 1 and 4) dividing 4 without remainder: :4 = 2 Â· 2. 5 is again prime: none of the numbers 2, 3, or 4 divide 5. Next, 6 is divisible by 2 or 3, since :6 = 2 Â· 3. Hence, 6 is not prime.  The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: {{nowrap|12 {{=}} 3 Â· 4}}. No [[even number]] greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number {{math|''n''}} has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and {{math|''n''}}. This implies that {{math|''n''}} is not prime. Accordingly, the term ''odd prime'' refers to any prime number greater than 2. In a similar vein, all prime numbers bigger than 5, written in the usual [[decimal]] system, end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.  If {{math|''n''}} is a natural number, then 1 and {{math|''n''}} divide {{math|''n''}} without remainder. Therefore, the condition of being a prime can also be restated as: a number is prime if it is greater than one and if none of :{{math|2, 3, ..., ''n'' âˆ’ 1}} divides {{math|''n''}} (without remainder). Yet another way to say the same is: a number {{math|''n'' > 1}} is prime if it cannot be written as a product of two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, both of which are larger than&amp;nbsp;1: :{{math|1=''n'' = ''a'' Â· ''b''}}. In other words, {{math|''n''}} is prime if {{math|''n''}} items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item.  The smallest 168 prime numbers (all the prime numbers under 1000) are:&lt;!--Do not add 1 to this list.

The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all primes is often denoted {{math|'''P'''}}.  ==Fundamental theorem of arithmetic== {{Main|Fundamental theorem of arithmetic}} The crucial importance of prime numbers to [[number theory]] and mathematics in general stems from the ''fundamental theorem of arithmetic'', which states that every positive integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime [[divisor|factors]].&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Dudley|year=1978|nb=yes|loc=Section 2, Theorem 2}}&lt;/ref> Primes can thus be considered the â€œbasic building blocksâ€? of the natural numbers. For example:  :{| |- |23244 ||= 2 Â· 2 Â· 3 Â· 13 Â· 149 |- |||= 2&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> Â· 3 Â· 13 Â· 149. (2&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> denotes the [[Square (algebra)|square]] or second power of 2.) |}  As in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition:  :{{math|1=''n'' = ''p''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> Â· ''p''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> Â· ... Â· ''p''&lt;sub>''t''&lt;/sub>}}  of a number {{math|''n''}} into (finitely many) prime factors {{math|''p''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>}}, {{math|''p''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>}}, ... to {{math|''p''&lt;sub>''t''&lt;/sub>}} is called ''prime factorization'' of {{math|''n''}}. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be rephrased so as to say that any factorization into primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. So, albeit there are many [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]] algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers, they all have to yield the same result.  If {{math|''p''}} is a prime number and {{math|''p''}} divides a product {{math|''ab''}} of integers, then {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''a''}} or {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''b''}}. This proposition is known as [[Euclid's lemma]].&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Dudley|year=1978|nb=yes|loc=Section 2, Lemma 5}}&lt;/ref>  It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.  ===Primality of one=== Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,&lt;ref>See, for example, David E. Joyce's commentary on [[Euclid's Elements]], [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/defVII1.html Book VII, definitions 1 and 2].&lt;/ref> so did not consider it a prime. In the 19th century however, many mathematicians did consider the number 1 a prime. For example, [[Derrick Norman Lehmer]]'s list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956,&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Riesel | year=1994|loc=p. 36|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref> started with 1 as its first prime.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Conway | last2=Guy | year=1996|loc=pp. 129â€“130|nb=yes }}&lt;/ref> [[Henri Lebesgue]] is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.&lt;ref> {{Citation |last1=Derbyshire |first1=John  |title=Prime  Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest  Unsolved Problem in  Mathematics  |accessdate=2008-03-11 |year=2003  |publisher=Joseph Henry Press |location=Washington,  D.C.  |isbn=978-0-309-08549-6 |oclc=249210614  |page=33  |chapter=The  Prime Number Theorem }}&lt;/ref> Although a large body of mathematical work is also valid when calling 1 a prime, the above fundamental theorem of arithmetic does not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as {{nowrap|3 Â· 5}} or {{nowrap| 1 Â· 3 Â· 5}}. If 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of [[Euler's totient function]] or the [[Sum-of-divisors function|sum of divisors function]].&lt;ref>"[http://primefan.tripod.com/Prime1ProCon.html "Arguments for and against the primality of 1]".&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/one.html "Why is the number one not prime?"]&lt;/ref>  ==History== [[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|thumb|430px|The [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] is a simple [[algorithm]] for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It was created in the 3rd century BC by [[Eratosthenes]], an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[mathematician]].  (Click to see animation.)]] There are hints in the surviving records of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the [[Egyptian fraction]] expansions in the [[Rhind papyrus]], for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]]. [[Euclid's Elements]] (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of primes]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. Euclid also showed how to construct a [[perfect number]] from a [[Mersenne prime]]. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.  After the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 [[Pierre de Fermat]] stated (without proof) [[Fermat's little theorem]] (later proved by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]). A special case of Fermat's theorem may have been known much earlier by the Chinese.  Fermat conjectured that all numbers of the form 2&lt;sup>2&lt;sup>''n''&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are prime (they are called [[Fermat number]]s) and he verified this up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 (or 2&lt;sup>16&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1). However, the very next Fermat number 2&lt;sup>32&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is composite (one of its prime factors is&amp;nbsp;641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.  The French monk [[Marin Mersenne]] looked at primes of the form 2&lt;sup>''p''&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;1, with ''p'' a prime.  They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.  Euler's work in number theory included many results about primes.  He showed the [[infinite sum|infinite series]] [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|{{nowrap|1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + â€¦}}]] is [[Divergent series|divergent]]. In 1747 he showed that the even [[perfect numbers]] are precisely the integers of the form 2&lt;sup>''p''âˆ’1&lt;/sup>(2&lt;sup>''p''&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.  At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss independently conjectured that as ''x'' tends to infinity, the number of primes up to ''x'' is [[Asymptote|asymptotic]] to ''x''/ln(''x''), where ln(''x'') is the [[natural logarithm]] of ''x''.   Ideas of Riemann in his [[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude|1859 paper on the zeta-function]] sketched a program that would lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. This outline was completed by [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la VallÃ©e-Poussin|de la VallÃ©e Poussin]], who independently proved the [[prime number theorem]] in 1896.  Proving a number is prime is not done (for large numbers) by trial division. Many mathematicians have worked on [[primality test]]s for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes [[PÃ©pin's test]] for Fermat numbers (1877), [[Proth's theorem]] (around 1878), the [[Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test]] (originated 1856),&lt;ref>[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History] [http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=135 Prime Curios!: 17014â€¦05727 (39-digits)]&lt;/ref> and the generalized [[Lucas primality test]]. More recent algorithms like [[Adlemanâ€“Pomeranceâ€“Rumely primality test|APRT-CL]], [[Elliptic curve primality proving|ECPP]], and [[AKS primality test|AKS]] work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.  For a long time, prime numbers were thought to have extremely limited application outside of [[pure mathematics]];{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} this changed in the 1970s when the concepts of [[public-key cryptography]] were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] cryptosystem algorithm.  Since 1951 all the [[largest known prime]]s have been found by [[computer]]s. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] and other [[distributed computing]] projects to find large primes have become popular in the last ten to fifteen years, while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.  ==Number of prime numbers== {{Main|Euclid's theorem}} There are [[infinitely]] many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence :2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... of prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as ''Euclid's theorem'' in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician [[Euclid]], since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] proof by [[Euler]], [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach's]] [[Fermat number#Basic properties|proof]] based on  [[Fermat number]]s,&lt;ref>[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0722.pdf Letter] in [[Latin]] from Goldbach to Euler, July 1730.&lt;/ref> [[Harry Furstenberg|Furstenberg's]] [[Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes|proof using general topology]],&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Furstenberg | year=1955 | nb=yes}}&lt;/ref> and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] elegant proof.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Ribenboim |year=2004|nb=yes|loc=p. 4}}&lt;/ref>  ===Euclid's proof=== Euclid's proof (Book IX, Proposition 20&lt;ref>James Williamson (translator and commentator), ''The Elements of Euclid, With Dissertations'', [[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1782, page 63, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX20.html English translation of Euclid's proof]&lt;/ref>) considers any finite set ''S'' of primes.  The key idea is to consider the product of all these numbers plus one:  : &lt;math> N = 1 + \prod_{p\in S} p. &lt;/math>  Like any other natural number, ''N'' is divisible by at least one prime number (it is possible that ''N'' itself is prime).  None of the primes by which ''N'' is divisible can be members of the finite set ''S'' of primes with which we started, because dividing ''N'' by any one of these leaves a remainder of&amp;nbsp;1.  Therefore the primes by which ''N'' is divisible are additional primes beyond the ones we started with.  Thus any finite set of primes can be extended to a larger finite set of primes.  It is often erroneously reported that Euclid begins with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime numbers, leading to a [[proof by contradiction|contradiction]], or that it contains precisely the ''n'' smallest primes rather than any arbitrary finite set of primes.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Hardy |first2=Catherine |last2=Woodgold |title=Prime Simplicity |journal=[[Mathematical Intelligencer]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=44â€“52 |doi= }}&lt;/ref>  Today, the product of the smallest ''n'' primes plus 1 is conventionally called the ''n''th [[Euclid number]].  ===Euler's analytical proof=== [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|Euler's proof]] uses the sum of the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of primes,  :&lt;math>S(p) = \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 5 + \frac 1 7 + \cdots + \frac 1 p.&lt;/math>  This sum becomes bigger than any arbitrary [[real number]] provided that ''p'' is big enough.&lt;ref>{{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | author1-link=Tom M.

The growth of ''S''(''p'') is quantified by [[Mertens' theorems|Mertens' second theorem]].&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations|year=1976|last1=Apostol|nb=yes|loc=Section 4.8, Theorem 4.12}}&lt;/ref> For comparison, the sum  :&lt;math>\frac 1 {1^2} + \frac 1 {2^2} + \frac 1 {3^2} + \cdots + \frac 1 {n^2} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac 1 {i^2}&lt;/math>  does not grow to infinity as ''n'' goes to infinity. In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers. [[Brun's theorem]] states that the sum of the reciprocals of [[twin prime]]s,  :&lt;math> \left( {\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}} \right) + \left( {\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7}} \right) + \left( {\frac{1}{{11}} + \frac{1}{{13}}} \right) +  \cdots = \sum\limits_{ \begin{smallmatrix} p \text{ prime, } \\ p + 2 \text { prime} \end{smallmatrix}} {\left( {\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{{p + 2}}} \right)}, &lt;/math> is finite.  ==Testing primality and integer factorization== There are various methods to determine whether a given number ''n'' is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods only tell whether ''n'' is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of ''n'' are called [[integer factorization|factorization]] algorithms.  ===Trial division=== The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer ''n'' is called ''[[trial division]]''. This routine consists of dividing ''n'' by each integer ''m'' that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the [[square root]] of ''n''. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then ''n'' is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if &lt;math>n=a b&lt;/math> is composite (with ''a'' and ''b'' â‰  1) then one of the factors ''a'' or ''b'' is necessarily at most &lt;math>\sqrt{n}&lt;/math>. For example, for &lt;math> n = 37 &lt;/math>, the trial divisions are by {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.}} None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to &lt;math>\sqrt{n}&lt;/math> is knownâ€”then trial divisions need to be checked only for those ''m'' that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (''m'' = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.  While a simple method, trial division quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows too rapidly as ''n'' increases. According to the prime number theorem explained below, the number of prime numbers less than &lt;math>\sqrt{n}&lt;/math> is approximately given by &lt;math>\sqrt{n} / \ln(\sqrt{n})&lt;/math>, so the algorithm may need up to this number of trial divisions to check the primality of ''n''. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup>20&lt;/sup>}}, this number is 450 millionâ€”too large for many practical applications.  ===Sieves=== An algorithm yielding all primes up to a given limit, such as required in the trial division method, is called a prime number [[sieve theory|sieve]]. The oldest example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] (see above) is useful for relatively small primes. The modern [[sieve of Atkin]] is more complicated, but faster when properly optimized. Before the advent of computers, lists of primes up to bounds like 10&lt;sup>7&lt;/sup> were also used.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Lehmer|year=1909}}.&lt;/ref>  ===Primality testing versus primality proving=== Modern primality tests for general numbers ''n'' can be divided into two main classes, [[probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] (or "Monte Carlo") and [[deterministic algorithm]]s. The former merely "test" whether ''n'' is prime in the sense that they declare ''n'' to be (definitely) composite or "[[probable prime|probably prime]]", the latter meaning that ''n'' may or may not be a prime number. Composite numbers that do pass a given primality test are referred to as [[pseudoprime]]s. For example, [[Fermat's primality test]] relies on [[Fermat's little theorem]]. This theorem says that for any prime number ''p'' and any integer ''a'' not divisible by ''p'',  {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup>''p'' âˆ’ 1&lt;/sup> âˆ’ 1}} is divisible by ''p''. Thus, if {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup>''n'' âˆ’ 1&lt;/sup> âˆ’ 1}} is not divisible by ''n'', ''n'' cannot be prime. However, ''n'' may be composite even if this divisibility holds. In fact, there are infinitely many composite numbers ''n'' that pass the Fermat primality test for every choice of ''a'' that is coprime with ''n'' ([[Carmichael number]]s), for example {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 561}}.  Deterministic algorithms do not erroneously report composite numbers as prime. In practice, the fastest such method is known as [[elliptic curve primality proving]]. Analyzing its run time is based on [[heuristic argument]]s, as opposed to the [[mathematical proof|rigorously proven]] [[algorithmic complexity|complexity]] of the more recent [[AKS primality test]]. Deterministic methods are typically slower than probabilistic ones, so the latter ones are typically applied first before a more time-consuming deterministic routine is employed.  The following table lists a number of prime tests. The running time is given in terms of ''n'', the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number ''k'' of tests performed. Moreover, Îµ is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the [[logarithm]] to an unspecified base. The [[big O notation]] means that, for example, elliptic curve primality proving requires a time that is bounded by a factor (not depending on ''n'', but on Îµ) times log&lt;sup>5+Îµ&lt;/sup>(''n'').  {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !

For example, to run [[Lucas primality test|Lucas' primality test]] requires the knowledge of the prime factors of {{nowrap|''n'' âˆ’ 1}}, while the [[Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test]] needs the prime factors of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} as input. For example, these tests can be applied to check whether :[[factorial|''n''!]] Â± 1 = 1 Â· 2 Â· 3 Â· ... Â· ''n'' Â± 1 are prime. Prime numbers of this form are known as [[factorial prime]]s. Other primes where either ''p'' + 1 or ''p'' âˆ’ 1 is of a particular shape include the [[Sophie Germain prime]]s (primes of the form 2''p'' + 1 with ''p'' prime), [[primorial prime]]s, [[Fermat prime]]s and [[Mersenne prime]]s, that is, prime numbers that are of the form {{nowrap|2&lt;sup>''p''&lt;/sup> âˆ’ 1}}, where ''p'' is an arbitrary prime. The Lucasâ€“Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the [[largest known prime|largest ''known'' prime]] has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.  Fermat primes are of the form :{{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub>''k''&lt;/sub> {{=}} 2&lt;sup>2&lt;sup>''k''&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> + 1}}, with ''k'' an arbitrary natural number. They are named after [[Pierre de Fermat]] who conjectured that all such numbers ''F''&lt;sub>''k''&lt;/sub> are prime. This was based on the evidence of the first five numbers in this seriesâ€”3, 5, 17, 257, and 65,537â€”being prime. However, ''F''&lt;sub>5&lt;/sub> is composite and so are all other Fermat numbers that have been verified as of 2011. A [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gon]] is [[constructible polygon|constructible using straightedge and compass]] if and only if :''n'' = 2&lt;sup>''i''&lt;/sup> Â· ''m'' where ''m'' is a product of any number of distinct Fermat primes and ''i'' is any natural number, including zero.  The following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types. Some of these primes have been found using [[distributed computing]]. In 2009, the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.&lt;ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0  | title= Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize | date= October 14, 2009 | publisher= Electronic Frontier Foundation | accessdate= 2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref> The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.&lt;ref>{{cite web  | url= http://www.eff.org/awards/coop | title= EFF Cooperative Computing Awards | date= | publisher= Electronic Frontier Foundation | accessdate= 2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref> Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number &lt;var>n&lt;/var>, multiplying it by 256&lt;sup>&lt;var>k&lt;/var>&lt;/sup> for some positive integer &lt;var>k&lt;/var>, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256&lt;sup>''k''&lt;/sup>''n'' + 1, 256&lt;sup>''k''&lt;/sup>(''n'' + 1) âˆ’ 1].  {| class="wikitable" |- !

[[Elliptic curve factorization]] is an algorithm relying on arithmetic on an [[elliptic curve]].  ==Distribution== In 1975, number theorist [[Don Zagier]] commented that primes both&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Havil |year=2003|loc=p. 171|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref> {{Cquote|grow like weeds among the natural numbers, seeming to obey no other law than that of chance [but also] exhibit stunning regularity [and] that there are laws governing their behavior, and that they obey these laws with almost military precision.}} The distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the prime number theorem, but no efficient [[formula for primes|formula for the ''n''-th prime]] is known.  There are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive non-primes, as for every positive integer &lt;math>n&lt;/math> the &lt;math>n&lt;/math> consecutive integers from &lt;math>(n+1)! + 2&lt;/math> to &lt;math>(n+1)! + n + 1&lt;/math> (inclusive) are all composite (as &lt;math>(n+1)! + k&lt;/math> is divisible by &lt;math>k&lt;/math> for &lt;math>k&lt;/math> between &lt;math>2&lt;/math> and &lt;math>n + 1&lt;/math>).  [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials :&lt;math>p(n) = a + bn\,&lt;/math> with [[coprime]] integers ''a'' and ''b'' take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different such polynomials with the same ''b'' have approximately the same proportions of primes.  The corresponding question for quadratic polynomials is less well-understood.  ===Formulas for primes=== {{main|formulas for primes}} There is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, [[Mills' theorem]] and a theorem of [[E. M. Wright|Wright]] assert that there are real constants ''A>1'' and Î¼ such that :&lt;math>\left \lfloor A^{3^{n}}\right \rfloor \text{ and } \left \lfloor 2^{\dots^{2^{2^\mu}}} \right \rfloor&lt;/math> are prime for any natural number ''n''. Here &lt;math>\lfloor - \rfloor&lt;/math> represents the [[floor function]], i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using [[Bertrand's postulate]] (proven first by [[Chebyshev]]), which states that there always exists at least one prime number ''p'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;2, for any natural number&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;>&amp;nbsp;3. However, computing ''A'' or Î¼ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.&lt;ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=oLKlk5o6WroC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 15&lt;/ref> Another formula is based on [[Wilson's theorem]] and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.  There is no non-constant [[polynomial]], even in several variables, that takes ''only'' prime values. However, there is a set of [[Diophantine equations]] in 9 variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its ''positive'' values are prime.  ===Number of prime numbers below a given number=== {{Main|Prime number theorem}} [[File:PrimeNumberTheorem.svg|A chart depicting Ï€(''n'') (blue), ''n'' / ln (''n'') (green) and Li(''n'') (red)|right|thumb|300px]] The [[prime counting function]] Ï€(''n'') is defined as the number of primes up to ''n''. For example Ï€(11) = 5, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. There are known [[algorithm]]s to compute exact values of Ï€(''n'') faster than it would be possible to compute each prime up to ''n''. The ''prime number theorem'' states that Ï€(''n'') is approximately given by :&lt;math>\pi(n) \approx \frac n {\ln n},&lt;/math> in the sense that the ratio of Ï€(''n'') and the right hand fraction [[convergent sequence|approaches]] 1 when ''n'' grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a number less than ''n'' is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in ''n''. A more accurate estimate for Ï€(''n'') is given by the [[offset logarithmic integral]] :&lt;math>\operatorname{Li}(n) = \int_2^n \frac{dt}{\ln t}.&lt;/math>  The prime number theorem also implies [[Approximation|estimates]] for the size of the ''n''-th prime number ''p''&lt;sub>''n''&lt;/sub> (i.e., ''p''&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> = 2, ''p''&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> = 3, etc.): up to a bounded factor, ''p''&lt;sub>''n''&lt;/sub> grows like {{nowrap|''n'' log(''n'')}}.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | year=1976}}, Section 4.6, Theorem 4.7&lt;/ref> In particular, the [[prime gap]]s, i.e. the differences {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub>''n''&lt;/sub> âˆ’ ''p''&lt;sub>''n''âˆ’1&lt;/sub>}} of two consecutive primes, become arbitrarily large. This latter statement can also be seen in a more elementary way by noting that the sequence {{nowrap| ''n''! + 2, ''n''! + 3, â€¦, ''n''! + ''n''}} (for the notation ''n''! read [[factorial]]) consists of {{nowrap|''n'' âˆ’ 1}} composite numbers, for any natural number ''n''.  ===Arithmetic progressions=== An [[arithmetic progression]] is the set of natural numbers that give the same remainder when divided by some fixed number&amp;nbsp;''q'' called [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]]. For example, :3, 12, 21, 30, 39, ..., is an arithmetic progression modulo {{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 9}}. Except for 3, none of these numbers is prime, since {{nowrap|3 + 9''n'' {{=}} 3(1 + 3''n'')}} so that the remaining numbers in this progression are all composite. (In general terms, all prime numbers above ''q'' are of the form [[primorial|''q''#]]Â·''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'', where 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''#, and ''m'' has no prime factor&amp;nbsp;â‰¤&amp;nbsp;''q''.)  Thus, the progression :''a'', {{nowrap|''a'' + ''q'',}} {{nowrap|''a'' + 2''q'',}} {{nowrap|''a'' + 3''q'', â€¦}} can have infinitely many primes only when ''a'' and ''q'' are [[coprime]], i.e., their [[greatest common divisor]] is one. If this necessary condition is satisfied, ''[[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]]'' asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes. The picture below illustrates this with {{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 9}}: the numbers are "wrapped around" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed. Primes are highlighted in red. The rows (=progressions) starting with {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 3}}, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number. In all other rows ({{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 1}}, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers. What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long runâ€”the [[Relative density (mathematics)|density]] of all primes congruent ''a'' modulo&amp;nbsp;9 is&amp;nbsp;1/6. [[File:Prime numbers in arithmetic progression mod&amp;nbsp;9 zoom in.png|center|Prime numbers (highlighted in red) in arithmetic progression modulo 9.|600px]] The [[Greenâ€“Tao theorem]] shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting of primes.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations|first1=Ben|last1=Green|author1-link=Ben J.

For bigger ''n'', it does take composite values. The [[Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F]] makes an asymptotic prediction about the density of primes among the values of [[quadratic polynomial]]s (with integer [[coefficient]]s ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'') :&lt;math>f(n) = a x^2 + bx + c\, &lt;/math> in terms of Li(''n'') and the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. However, progress has proved hard to come by: no quadratic polynomial (with {{nowrap|''a'' â‰  0}}) is known to take infinitely many prime values. The [[Ulam spiral]] depicts all natural numbers in a spiral-like way. Surprisingly, prime numbers cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than other ones.  ==Open questions== ===Zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis=== {{Main|Riemann hypothesis}} [[File:Riemann zeta function absolute value.png|right|thumb|Plot of the zeta function Î¶(''s''). At ''s''=1, the function has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]], that is to say, it tends to [[infinity]].]]  The [[Riemann zeta function]] Î¶(''s'') is defined as an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] :&lt;math>\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infin \frac{1}{n^s},&lt;/math> where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] with [[real part]] bigger than 1. It is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that this sum agrees with the [[infinite product]] :&lt;math>\prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}.&lt;/math> The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then Î¶(1) would have a finite value. However, the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] {{nowrap|1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...}} [[divergent series|diverges]] (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern [[algebraic number theory]] is the following identity ([[Basel problem]]), due to Euler, :&lt;math>\zeta(2) = \prod_{p} \frac{1}{1-p^{-2}}= \frac{\pi^2}{6}.&lt;/math> The reciprocal of Î¶(2), 6/Ï€&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>, is the [[probability]] that two numbers selected at random are [[coprime|relatively prime]].&lt;ref>C. S. Ogilvy &amp; J. T. Anderson ''Excursions in Number Theory'', pp. 29â€“35, Dover Publications Inc., 1988 ISBN 0-486-25778-9&lt;/ref>  The unproven ''Riemann hypothesis'', dating from 1859, states that except for {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} âˆ’2, âˆ’4, ...,}} all [[zero of a function|zeroes]] of the Î¶-function have [[real part]] equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log ''x'' of numbers less than ''x'' are primes, the [[prime number theorem]]) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of ''x'' (for intervals near ''x''). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.  ===Other conjectures=== {{Further|:Category:Conjectures about prime numbers}} In addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of [[Landau's problems]] from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is [[Goldbach's conjecture]], which asserts that every even integer ''n'' greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. {{As of|February 2011}}, this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2 Â· 10&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>}}.&lt;ref>{{cite web|author=TomÃ¡s Oliveira e Silva |url=http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/goldbach.html |title=Goldbach conjecture verification |publisher=Ieeta.pt |date=2011-04-09 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref> Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example [[Vinogradov's theorem]] says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. [[Chen's theorem]] says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a [[semiprime]], the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.&lt;ref>{{Citation | first=O. | last=RamarÃ© | authorlink=Olivier RamarÃ© | title=On Å¡nirel'man's constant | journal=Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.

Other conjectures deal with the question whether an infinity of prime numbers subject to certain constraints exists. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many [[Fibonacci prime]]s&lt;ref>Caldwell, Chris, [http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=48 ''The Top Twenty: Lucas Number''] at The [[Prime Pages]].&lt;/ref> and infinitely many [[Mersenne prime]]s, but not [[Fermat prime]]s.&lt;ref>E.g., see {{Harvard citations | last1=Guy | year=1981|loc=problem A3, pp. 7â€“8|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref> It is not known whether or not there are an infinite number of [[Wieferich prime]]s and of prime [[Euclid number]]s.  A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many [[twin prime]]s, pairs of primes with difference 2 ([[twin prime conjecture]]). [[Polignac's conjecture]] is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer ''n'', there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by&amp;nbsp;2''n''.&lt;ref>{{Citation | last1=Tattersall | first1=J.J. | title=Elementary number theory in nine chapters | url=http://books.google.de/books?id=QGgLbf2oFUYC | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-85014-8 | year=2005}}, p. 112&lt;/ref> It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=LandausProblems|title=Landau's Problems}}&lt;/ref> These conjectures are special cases of the broad [[Schinzel's hypothesis H]]. [[Brocard's conjecture]] says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. [[Legendre's conjecture]] states that there is a prime number between ''n''&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> for every positive integer&amp;nbsp;''n''. It is implied by the stronger [[CramÃ©r's conjecture]].  ==Applications== For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic. In particular, number theorists such as [[United Kingdom|British]] mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Hardy |year=1940|nb=yes}} "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years."&lt;/ref> However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of [[public key cryptography]] algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for [[hash table]]s and [[pseudorandom number generator]]s.  Some [[rotor machine]]s were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or [[coprime]] to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the [[full cycle]] of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.  The [[International Standard Book Number]]s work with a [[check digit]], which exploits the fact that 11 is a prime.  ===Arithmetic modulo a prime and finite fields=== {{Main|Modular arithmetic}} ''Modular arithmetic'' modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers :&lt;math>\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \}, \,&lt;/math> where ''n'' is a fixed natural number called modulus. Calculating sums, differences and products is done as usual, but whenever a negative number or a number greater than ''n''&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;1 occurs, it gets replaced by the [[remainder]] after division by ''n''. For instance, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7, the sum 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainder&amp;nbsp;1. This is referred to by saying "3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 is congruent to&amp;nbsp;1 modulo&amp;nbsp;7" and is denoted :&lt;math>3 + 5 \equiv 1 \pmod 7.&lt;/math> Similarly, 6&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;â‰¡&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;7), 2&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;â‰¡&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;7), since âˆ’3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, and 3&amp;nbsp;Â·&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;â‰¡&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;7) as 12 has remainder 5. Standard properties of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]  familiar from the [[integer]]s remain valid in modular arithmetic. In the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the above set of integers, which is also denoted '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', is therefore a [[commutative ring]] for any ''n''. [[Division (mathematics)|Division]], however, is not in general possible in this setting. For example, for ''n'' = 6, the equation  :&lt;math>3 \cdot x \equiv 2 \pmod 6,&lt;/math>  a solution ''x'' of which would be an analogue of 2/3, cannot be solved, as one can see by calculating 3 Â· 0, ..., 3 Â· 5 modulo 6. The distinctive feature of prime numbers is the following: division ''is'' possible in modular arithmetic [[if and only if]] ''n'' is a prime. Equivalently, ''n'' is prime if and only if all integers ''m'' satisfying {{nowrap|2 â‰¤ ''m'' â‰¤ ''n'' âˆ’ 1}} are ''[[coprime]]'' to ''n'', i.e. their only [[Greatest common divisor|common divisor]] is one. Indeed, for ''n'' = 7, the equation :&lt;math>3 \cdot x \equiv 2 \ \ (\operatorname{mod}\ 7),&lt;/math> has a unique solution, {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 3}}. Because of this, for any prime ''p'', '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' (also denoted '''F'''&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub>) is called a [[field (mathematics)|field]] or, more specifically, a [[finite field]] since it contains finitely many, namely ''p'', elements.  A number of theorems can be derived from inspecting '''F'''&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub> in this abstract way. For example, [[Fermat's little theorem]], stating :&lt;math>a^{p-1} \equiv 1 (\operatorname{mod}\ p)&lt;/math> for any integer ''a'' not divisble by ''p'', may be proved using these notions. This implies :&lt;math>\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} a^{p-1} \equiv (p-1) \cdot 1 \equiv -1 \pmod p.&lt;/math> [[Giuga's conjecture]] says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for ''p'' to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if ''p'' is a prime number other than 2 and 5, &lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>/&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub> is always a [[recurring decimal]], whose period is {{nowrap|''p'' âˆ’ 1}} or a divisor of {{nowrap|''p'' âˆ’ 1}}.  The fraction &lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>/&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub> expressed likewise in base ''q'' (rather than base&amp;nbsp;10) has similar effect, provided that ''p'' is not a prime factor of&amp;nbsp;''q''. [[Wilson's theorem]] says that an integer ''p''&amp;nbsp;>&amp;nbsp;1 is prime if and only if the [[factorial]] (''p''&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;1)!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is divisible by ''p''. Moreover, an integer ''n'' > 4 is composite if and only if (''n''&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;nowiki>!&lt;/nowiki> is divisible by&amp;nbsp;''n''.  ===Other mathematical occurrences of primes=== Many mathematical domains make great use of prime numbers. An example from the theory of [[finite group]]s are the [[Sylow theorems]]: if ''G'' is a finite group and ''p''&lt;sup>''n''&lt;/sup> is the [[p-adic order|highest power of the prime ''p'' that divides]] the [[order of a group|order]] of ''G'', then ''G'' has a subgroup of order ''p''&lt;sup>''n''&lt;/sup>. Also, any group of prime order is cyclic ([[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]]). &lt;!--* If ''G'' is a finite group and ''p'' is a prime number dividing the order of ''G'', then ''G'' contains an element of order ''p''. ([[Cauchy's theorem (group theory)|Cauchy Theorem]])-->  ===Public-key cryptography=== {{main|Public key cryptography}} Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and the [[Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange]], are based on large prime numbers (for example 512 [[bit]] primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024 bit primes are typical for Diffieâ€“Hellman.). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers ''x'' and ''y'' than to calculate ''x'' and ''y'' (assumed [[coprime]]) if only the product ''xy'' is known. The Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for [[modular exponentiation]], while the reverse operation the [[discrete logarithm]] is thought to be a hard problem.  ===Prime numbers in nature=== Inevitably, some of the numbers that occur in nature are prime. There are, however, relatively few examples of numbers that appear in nature ''because'' they are prime.  One example of the use of prime numbers in nature is as an evolutionary strategy used by [[cicada]]s of the genus ''[[Magicicada]]''.&lt;ref>{{cite journal |last=Goles |first=E. |last2=Schulz |first2=O. |first3=M. |last3=Markus |year=2001 |title=Prime number selection of cycles in a predator-prey model |journal=[[Complexity (journal)|Complexity]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=33â€“38 |doi=10.1002/cplx.1040 }}&lt;/ref> These insects spend most of their lives as [[larva|grubs]] underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on ''Magicicadas''.&lt;ref>{{Citation | author = Paulo R.

There is speculation that the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] are connected to the energy levels of complex quantum systems.&lt;ref>{{cite web |author=Ivars Peterson | work=[[MAA Online]]| url=http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_6_28_99.html |title=The Return of Zeta |date=June 28, 1999|accessdate=2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref>  ==Generalizations== The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the [[prime field]] is the smallest subfield of a field ''F'' containing both 0 and 1. It is either '''Q''' or the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements, whence the name.&lt;ref>{{Citation | last1=Lang | first1=Serge | author1-link=Serge Lang | title=Algebra | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-95385-4 | mr=1878556 | year=2002 | volume=211}}, Section II.1, p. 90&lt;/ref> Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in [[knot theory]], a [[prime knot]] is a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the [[knot sum]] of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.&lt;ref>Schubert, H. "Die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit eines Knotens in Primknoten". ''S.-B Heidelberger Akad. Wiss. Math.-Nat. Kl.'' 1949 (1949), 57â€“104.&lt;/ref> [[Prime model]]s and [[prime 3-manifold]]s are other examples of this type.  ===Prime elements in rings=== {{Main|Prime element|Irreducible element}} Prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any [[commutative ring]] ''R'', an [[algebraic structure]] where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: ''prime elements'' and ''irreducible elements''. An element ''p'' of ''R'' is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (i.e., does not have a [[multiplicative inverse]]) and satisfies the following requirement: given ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''p'' divides the product ''xy'', then ''p'' divides ''x'' or ''y''. An element is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units. In the ring '''Z''' of integers, the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements, which is  :&lt;math>\{ \dots, -11, -7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots \}\, .&lt;/math>  In any ring ''R'', any prime element is irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for [[unique factorization domain]]s.  The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the [[Gaussian integer]]s '''Z'''[''i''], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'' where ''i'' denotes the [[imaginary unit]] and ''a'' and ''b'' are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as [[Gaussian prime]]s. Not every prime (in '''Z''') is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring '''Z'''[''i''], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'') and (1&amp;nbsp;âˆ’&amp;nbsp;''i''). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in '''Z''') of the form 4''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are not.  ===Prime ideals=== {{Main|Prime ideals}} In [[ring theory]], the notion of number is generally replaced with that of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]. ''Prime ideals'', which generalize prime elements in the sense that the [[principal ideal]] generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in [[commutative algebra]], [[number theory|algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), â€¦ The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the [[Laskerâ€“Noether theorem]], which expresses every ideal in a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[commutative ring]] as an intersection of [[primary ideal]]s, which are the appropriate generalizations of [[prime power]]s.&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | last1=Eisenbud | year=1995 |nb=yes|loc=section 3.3.}}&lt;/ref>  Prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the [[spectrum of a ring]].&lt;ref>Shafarevich, Basic Algebraic Geometry volume 2 (Schemes and Complex Manifolds), p. 5, section V.1&lt;/ref> [[Arithmetic geometry]] also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|ramification]] of prime ideals when lifted to an [[field extension|extension field]], a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with [[ramified cover|ramification in geometry]]. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the [[ring of integers]] of [[quadratic number field]]s can be used in proving [[quadratic reciprocity]], a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations :&lt;math>x^2 \equiv p \ \ (\text{mod } q),\,&lt;/math> where ''x'' is an integer and ''p'' and ''q'' are (usual) prime numbers.&lt;ref>Neukirch, Algebraic Number theory, p. 50, Section I.8&lt;/ref> Early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] climaxed when [[Kummer]] introduced [[regular prime]]s, primes satisfying a certain requirement concerning the failure of unique factorization in the ring consisting of expressions :&lt;math>a_0 + a_1 \zeta + \cdots + a_{p-1} \zeta^{p-1}\, , &lt;/math> where ''a''&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>, ..., ''a''&lt;sub>''p''âˆ’1&lt;/sub> are integers and Î¶ is a complex number such that [[root of unity|{{nowrap|Î¶&lt;sup>''p''&lt;/sup> {{=}} 1}}]].&lt;ref>Neukirch, Algebraic Number theory, p. 38, Section I.7&lt;/ref>  ===Valuations=== [[Valuation theory]] studies certain functions from a field ''K'' to the real numbers '''R''' called [[Valuation (algebra)|valuations]].&lt;ref>Endler, Valuation Theory, p. 1&lt;/ref>  Every such valuation yields a [[topological field|topology on ''K'']], and two valuations are called equivalent if they yield the same topology. A ''prime of K'' (sometimes called a ''place of K'') is an [[equivalence class]] of valuations. For example, the [[p-adic order|''p''-adic valuation]] of a rational number ''q'' is defined to be the integer ''v''&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub>(''q''), such that :&lt;math>q = p^{v_p(q)} \frac {r}{s},&lt;/math> where both ''r'' and ''s'' are not divisible by ''p''. For example, {{nowrap|''v''&lt;sub>3&lt;/sub>(18/7) {{=}} 2.}} The ''p''-adic norm is defined as&lt;ref group=nb>Some sources also put &lt;math>\left| q \right|_p := e^{-v_p(q)}. \,&lt;/math>.&lt;/ref> :&lt;math>\left| q \right|_p := p^{-v_p(q)}. \,&lt;/math> In particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by ''p'', in sharp contrast to the usual [[absolute value]] (also referred to as the [[infinite prime]]). While [[Completion (ring theory)|completing]] '''Q''' (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real (number)|real numbers]], completing with respect to the ''p''-adic norm |âˆ’|&lt;sub>''p''&lt;/sub> yields the field of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].&lt;ref>Gouvea: p-adic numbers: an introduction, Chapter 3, p. 43&lt;/ref> These are essentially all possible ways to complete '''Q''', by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. Certain arithmetic questions related to '''Q''' or more general [[global field]]s may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or [[local field|local]]) fields. This [[local-global principle]] again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.  ==In the arts and literature== Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers.  The French [[composer]] [[Olivier Messiaen]] used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena". In works such as ''[[La NativitÃ© du Seigneur]]'' (1935) and ''[[Quatre Ã©tudes de rythme]]'' (1949â€“50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47  and 53 appear in the third Ã©tude, "Neumes rythmiques". According to Messiaen this way of composing was "inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations".&lt;ref>{{Harvard citations | editor1-last=Hill  | year=1995|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref>  In his science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', [[NASA]] scientist [[Carl Sagan]] suggested that prime numbers could be used as a means of communicating with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer [[Frank Drake]] in 1975.&lt;ref>[[Carl Pomerance]], [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/extraterrestrial.pdf Prime Numbers and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence], Retrieved on December 22, 2007&lt;/ref> In the novel ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]], the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers.&lt;ref>Mark Sarvas, [http://www.themodernword.com/reviews/haddon.html Book Review: ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time''], at [http://www.themodernword.com/site_info.html The Modern Word], Retrieved on March 30, 2012&lt;/ref>  Many films, such as ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]'', ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'', ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]'' and ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' reflect a popular fascination with the mysteries of prime numbers and cryptography.&lt;ref>[http://www.musicoftheprimes.com/films.htm The music of primes], [[Marcus du Sautoy]]'s selection of films featuring prime numbers.&lt;/ref> Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the [[Paolo Giordano]] novel ''[[The Solitude of Prime Numbers]]'', in which they are portrayed as "outsiders" among integers.&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing Paolo Giordano|url=http://www.wbqonline.com/feature.do?featureid=342|publisher=Books Quarterly}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref>  ==See also== &lt;div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> * [[Adlemanâ€“Pomeranceâ€“Rumely primality test]] * [[Bonse's inequality]] * [[Brun sieve]] * [[Burnside theorem]] * [[Chebotarev's density theorem]] * [[Chinese remainder theorem]] * [[Cullen number]] * [[List of prime numbers]] * [[Mersenne prime]] * [[Multiplicative number theory]] * [[Number field sieve]] * [[Pepin's test]] * [[Prime k-tuple]] * [[Primon gas]] * [[Quadratic residuosity problem]] * [[RSA number]] * [[Smooth number]] * [[Super-prime]] * [[Woodall number]] &lt;/div>  ==Notes== &lt;references group=nb/> {{reflist|30em}}  ==References== * {{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Thomas M. | author1-link=Thomas M.

Today, the term is applied to [[nurse]]s, [[accountants]], [[educators]], [[scientists]], [[IT Professional|technology experts]], [[social workers]], [[artists]], librarians (information professionals) and many more.  The term is also used in sports to differentiate [[Amateur sports|amateur]] players from those who are paidâ€”hence "[[professional footballer]]" and "[[professional golfer]]". Many companies include the word professional in their store name to imply the quality of their workmanship or service.  In some cultures, the term is used as shorthand to describe a particular social stratum of well-educated, salaried workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy and are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work.&lt;ref name="Gilbert">Gilbert, D.

The professional owes a higher duty to a client, often a privilege of confidentiality, as well as a duty not to abandon the client just because he or she may not be able to pay or remunerate the professional. Often the professional is required to put the interest of the client ahead of his own interests. # Reasonable work morale and motivation. Having interest and desire to do a job well as holding positive attitude towards the profession are important elements in attaining a high level of professionalism. # Appropriate treatment of relationships with colleagues.  Consideration should be shown to elderly, junior or inexperienced colleagues, as well as those with special needs.  An example must be set to perpetuate the attitude of one's business without doing it harm. # A professional is an expert who is a master in a specific field.  ===Trades=== In narrow usage, not all expertise is considered a profession. Although sometimes referred to as professions, occupations such as skilled construction and maintenance work are more generally thought of as [[Trade (profession)|trade]]s or crafts. The completion of an apprenticeship is generally associated with skilled labor or trades such as [[carpenter]], [[electrician]], [[Stonemasonry|mason]], [[House painter and decorator|painter]], [[plumber]] and other similar occupations. A related distinction would be that a professional does mainly [[Mind|mental]] or [[Administration (business)|administrative]] work, as opposed to engaging in physical work.  ==Sports== {{Main|Professional sport}}  In sports, a professional is someone who receives monetary compensation for participating. The opposite is an [[amateur]], meaning a person who does not receive monetary compensation. The term "professional" is commonly used incorrectly when referring to sports, as the distinction simply refers to how the athlete is funded, and not necessarily competitions or achievements.  Sometimes the professional status of an activity is controversial; for example, there is debate as to whether [[Professional sport|professionals]] should be allowed to compete in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. The motivation for money (either in rewards, salaries or advertising revenue) is sometimes seen as a corrupting influence, tainting a sport.  It has been suggested that the crude, all or nothing categories, of professional or amateur should be reconsidered. A historical shift is occurring with the rise of [[Pro-Ams|Pro&amp;#8209;Ams]], a new category of people pursuing amateur activities to professional standards.  ==Criticisms== Although professional training appears to be ideologically neutral, it is, in fact, biased towards those with superior [[Social class|class background]]s and a formal education. They are more likely to have conservative political opinions and are unlikely to challenge the orthodoxy of the profession. In his 2000 book, ''[[Disciplined Minds]]: A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-Battering System that Shapes Their Lives'', [[Jeff Schmidt (writer)|Jeff Schmidt]] observes that qualified professionals are less creative and diverse in their opinions and habits than non-professionals, which he attributes to the subtle indoctrination and filtering which accompanies the process of professional training. His evidence is both qualitative and quantitative, including professional examinations, industry statistics and personal accounts of trainees and professionals.&lt;ref>Schmidt, Jeff, 2000, ''Disciplined Minds - A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-Battering System that Shapes their Lives'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.293.&lt;/ref> A study on journalistic professionalism argued that professionalism is a combination of two factors, secondary [[socialization]] of journalists in the workplace and the [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of journalistic norms and standards &lt;ref> Hearns-Branaman, Jesse Owen, 2013, 'Journalistic professionalism as indirect control and fetishistic disavowal,' ''Journalism'' [http://jou.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/02/14/1464884912474202.full.pdf+html] &lt;/ref>. In this way, undesirable traits in new employees can be weeded out, and remaining employees are free to cynically criticize their professional norms as long as they keep working and following them. The latter concept adapted from philosopher [[Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek]] and his concept of [[ideology]] &lt;ref> Å½iÅ¾ek, Slavoj, 1989, ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]'' (London, Verso)&lt;/ref>.  ==See also== * [[Centre for the Study of Professions]] * [[Organizational culture]] * [[Profession]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Occupations]] [[Category:Management]]  [[cs:ProfesionÃ¡l]] [[de:Profi]] [[ja:ãƒ—ãƒ­ãƒ•ã‚§ãƒƒã‚·ãƒ§ãƒŠãƒ«]] [[sk:ProfesionÃ¡l]] [[uk:Ð¤Ð°Ñ…Ñ–Ð²ÐµÑ†ÑŒ]]

Statisticians improve data quality by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting the use of data and [[statistical model]]s. Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of [[academic discipline]]s, including [[natural]] and [[social science]]s, government, and business. [[Statistical consultant]]s can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.  Statistical methods can summarize or describe a collection of data. This is called ''[[descriptive statistics]]''. This is particularly useful in communicating the results of experiments and research. In addition, data patterns may be [[mathematical model|modeled]] in a way that accounts for [[randomness]] and uncertainty in the observations.  These models can be used to draw inferences about the process or population under studyâ€”a practice called ''[[inferential statistics]]''. Inference is a vital element of scientific advance, since it provides a way to draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation. To prove the propositions being investigated further, the conclusions are tested as well, as part of the [[scientific method]]. Descriptive statistics and analysis of the new data tend to provide more information as to the truth of the proposition.  "Applied statistics" comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.&lt;ref>Anderson, D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A..

Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of [[probability distribution]]s necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of [[computational statistics]] and the [[design of experiments]].  Statistics is closely related to [[probability theory]], with which it is often grouped. The difference is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite directionâ€”[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.  ==History== {{Main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}  Statistical methods date back at least to the 5th century BC. The earliest known writing on statistics appears in a 9th century book entitled ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'', written by [[Al-Kindi]]. In this book, Al-Kindi provides a detailed description of how to use statistics and [[frequency analysis]] to decipher encrypted messages. This was the birth of both statistics and cryptanalysis, according to the Saudi engineer Ibrahim Al-Kadi.&lt;ref name=ibr1992>Al-Kadi, Ibrahim A.

''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4):321â€“328. {{jstor|1400906}}&lt;/ref> Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.  Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Probability theory arose from the study of games of chance. The [[method of least squares]] was first described by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1794. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computation, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. &lt;!-- Hide statement about "greatest statisticians" that appeared in another article with a supposed source that didn't say anything close to this: The American Statistical Association has ranked [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]], [[Ronald Fisher|R A Fisher]], and [[CR Rao| C R Rao]] as the greatest statisticians of all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} -->  ==Overview== In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, it is necessary to begin with a [[statistical population|population]] or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". A population can also be composed of observations of a process at various times, with the data from each observation serving as a different member of the overall group.  Data collected about this kind of "population" constitutes what is called a [[time series]].  For practical reasons, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studiedâ€”as opposed to compiling data about the entire group (an operation called [[census]]). Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. This data can then be subjected to statistical analysis, serving two related purposes: description and inference. * [[Descriptive statistics]] summarize the population data by describing what was observed in the sample numerically or graphically. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like heights or weights), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like race). * [[Inferential statistics]] uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of time series or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].&lt;ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Leo Breiman | first = Leo | last = Breiman | year = 2001 | id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.156.4933}} | title = Statistical Modelling: the two cultures | journal = [[Statistical Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 199â€“231 | doi = 10.1214/ss/1009213726 | mr = 1874152 }}&lt;/ref> {{Quote box | quote = "... it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us.

Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See [[Correlation does not imply causation]].)  To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly representat that overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any random trending within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of [[experimental design]] for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.  Randomness is studied using the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in "[[mathematical statistics]]" (alternatively, "[[statistical theory]]") to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the  assumptions of the method.  [[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretationâ€”subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics. [[#Misuse|See below]] for further discussion.  Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the dataâ€”which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sampleâ€”may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].  ==Statistical methods== ===Experimental and observational studies=== A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[independent variable]]s on [[dependent variable]]s or response. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[controlled experiment|experimental studies]] and [[observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.  ====Experiments==== The basic steps of a statistical experiment are: # Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects. # [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and  [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that shall guide the performance of the experiment and that specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data. # Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol. # Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study. # Documenting and presenting the results of the study.  Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  ====Observational study==== An example of an observational study is one that explores the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[case-control study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.  ===Levels of measurement=== {{Main|Levels of measurement}} There are four main [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]] used in statistics: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.&lt;ref>Thompson, B. (2006). Foundations of behavioral statistics. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref> Each of these have different degrees of usefulness in statistical [[research]]. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined; they provide the greatest flexibility in statistical methods that can be used for analyzing the data.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and temperature measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]). Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values. Nominal measurements have no meaningful rank order among values.  Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature.  ===Key terms used in statistics=== ====Null hypothesis==== Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] in that the assumption is that whatever is proposed as a cause has no effect on the variable being measured.  The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a jury trial. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub> (status quo) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> and is maintained unless H&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> is supported by evidence"beyond a reasonable doubt". However,"failure to reject H&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub> but ''fails to reject'' H&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>. While one can not "prove" a null hypothesis one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for type II errors.  ====Error==== Working from a [[null hypothesis]] two basic forms of error are recognized: *[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive". *[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a ''false negative''.  Error also refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean.  Many statistical methods seek to minimize the mean-squared error, and these are called "[[least squares|methods of least squares]]."  Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other important types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important.  ====Interval estimation==== {{Main|Interval estimation}} Most studies only sample part of a population , so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value 95% of the time. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by "probability"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].  ====Significance==== {{Main|Statistical significance}} {{No footnotes|section|date=May 2012}} Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question asked of them. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).  Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.  Criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be "favored," and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests in account for this. (See also [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Controversy|criticism of hypothesis testing]].)  One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The ''p''-value, however, does not indicate the size of the effect. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.  ===Examples=== Some well-known statistical [[Statistical hypothesis testing|tests]] and [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] are: &lt;div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"> * [[Analysis of variance]] (ANOVA) * [[Chi-squared test]] * [[Correlation]] * [[Factor analysis]] * [[Mannâ€“Whitney U|Mannâ€“Whitney ''U'']] * [[Mean square weighted deviation]] (MSWD) * [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] * [[Regression analysis]] * [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] * [[Student's t-test|Student's ''t''-test]] * [[Time series analysis]] &lt;/div>  ==Specialized disciplines== {{Main|List of fields of application of statistics}}  Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]],  [[computational biology]],  [[computational sociology]],  [[network biology]],  [[social science]],  [[sociology]] and  [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include: &lt;div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"> * [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries) * [[Applied information economics]] * [[Biostatistics]] * [[Business statistics]] * [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]]) * [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data) * [[Demography]] * [[Econometrics]] * [[Energy statistics]] * [[Engineering statistics]] * [[Epidemiology]] * [[Geography]] and [[Geographic Information Systems]], specifically in [[Spatial analysis]] * [[Image processing]] * [[Psychological statistics]] * [[Reliability engineering]] * [[Social statistics]]  In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology: * [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]] &amp; [[Resampling (statistics)|Jackknife Resampling]] * [[Multivariate statistics]] * [[Statistical classification]] * [[Statistical survey]]s * [[Structured data analysis (statistics)]] * [[Structural equation modelling]] * [[Survival analysis]] * Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]] &lt;/div>  Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.  ==Statistical computing== [[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gretl]], an example of an [[open source]] statistical package]] {{Main|Computational statistics}}  The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.  Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as permutation tests and the [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available.  ==Misuse== {{Main|Misuse of statistics}}  There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name=Huff>Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie With Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc.

This has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically. Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas. * In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses. * Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty. * The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed. With the advent of computers, methods of statistics were applied to formalize such distribution driven natural processes, in order to make and analyze moving video art. * Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology. * Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.  ==See also== {{Portal|Statistics}} {{Sister project links|Statistics}} {{Main|Outline of statistics}} &lt;!-- NOTE: This is mainly for statistics-related lists.

Trade is sometimes loosely called [[commerce]] or [[financial transaction]] or barter. A network that allows trade is called a [[market]].  The original form of trade was [[barter (economics)|barter]], the direct exchange of goods and services.  Later one side of the barter were the metals, precious metals (poles{{Clarify|date=October 2012|Poles? What is a pole?}}, coins), bill, paper money. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as [[money]]. As a result, '''buying''' can be separated from '''selling''', or [[Earnings|earning]]. The invention of money (and later credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.  Trade exists for man due to specialization and division of labor, in which most people concentrate on a small aspect of production, trading for other products.  Trade exists between regions because different regions have a [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable [[commodity]], or because different regions size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]]. As such, trade at [[market price]]s between locations benefits both locations.  [[Retail]] trade consists of the [[sales|sale]] of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location, such as a [[department store]], [[boutique]] or [[kiosk]], or by [[mail]], in small or individual lots for direct [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] by the purchaser.&lt;ref name="fas">{{cite web|date=2000-02-09|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/factsheets/China/distribution.html|title=Distribution Services|publisher=[[Foreign Agricultural Service]]|accessdate=2006-04-04}}&lt;/ref> [[Wholesale]] trade is defined as the sale of goods or [[merchandise]] to [[retailer]]s, to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional [[business]] users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.&lt;ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/completeacc_e.htm#chn WTO â€“ World Trade Organization]&lt;/ref>  Trading can also refer to the action performed by [[trader (finance)|traders]] and other market agents in the [[financial markets]].  ==History of trade== {{Systemic bias|bias=European history|1=History section POV problem: Euro-centric|date=August 2010}} {{Trade route}}  ===Prehistory=== Trade originated with the [[history of communication|start of communication]] in [[prehistoric]] times.

Trade however continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, Middle East, India, China and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in the west. For instance, [[Radhanite]]s were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of [[Jew]]ish merchants who traded between the [[Christian]]s in [[Europe]] and the [[Muslim]]s of the [[Near East]].  ====the Orient====  Archaeological evidence (Greenberg 1951) of the first use of trade-marks are from China dated about 2700 BC.&lt;ref>AS Greenberg - J.

They were the main [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] merchants of [[Central Asia]].  From the 8th to the 11th century, the [[Viking]]s and [[Varangians]] traded as they sailed from and to [[Scandinavia]].  Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to [[Russia]].  The [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over most of [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], between the 13th and 17th centuries.  ===Age of Discovery=== [[Vasco da Gama]] pioneered the European [[Spice trade]] in 1498 when he reached [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] after sailing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the [[Age of Discovery]] in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling [[gold]].  In the 16th century, the [[Seventeen Provinces]] were the centre of free trade, imposing no [[exchange control]]s, and advocating the free movement of goods.  Trade in the [[East Indies]] was dominated by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century, [[Holland]] in the 17th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 18th century. The [[Spanish Empire]] developed regular trade links across both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. [[File:Wojciech Gerson - GdaÅ„sk in the XVII century.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danzig]] in the 17th century]] In 1776, [[Adam Smith]] published the paper ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. It criticised [[Mercantilism]], and argued that [[economic]] [[Specialization (functional)|specialisation]] could benefit nations just as much as firms.  Since the [[division of labour]] was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more [[productive]]. Smith said that he considered all rationalisations of [[International trade|import]] and [[export]] controls "dupery", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.  In 1799, the [[Dutch East India Company]], formerly the world's largest company, became [[bankrupt]], partly due to the rise of competitive free trade. [[File:Berber Trade with Timbuktu 1300s.jpg|thumb|left|Berber Trade with [[Timbuktu]], 1853]]  ===Age of Reason=== In 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]: : ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''  The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.  [[John Stuart Mill]] proved that a country with monopoly [[pricing power]] on the international market could manipulate the [[terms of trade]] through maintaining [[tariff]]s, and that the response to this might be [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in trade policy.  Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier.  This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the [[economic surplus]] of trade would accrue to a country following ''reciprocal'', rather than completely free, trade policies.  This was followed within a few years by the [[infant industry]] scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that government had the "duty" to [[protectionism|protect]] young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to [[industrialize|industrialise]] and out-compete [[England|English]] exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.&lt;ref>Price theory Milton Friedman&lt;/ref>  ===20th century=== The [[Great Depression]] was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s.  During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.  The lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Only during the [[World War II]] the recession ended in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions.  It set up rules and institutions to regulate the [[international political economy]]: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements).  These organisations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement.  In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] to promote free trade.  During the early years of the Cold-war, the United States of America and the then Soviet USSR were engaged in talks to exchange two captured military personnel, a "trade"  carried out during 1962 (Polmar p.&amp;nbsp;142).&lt;ref>N Polmar - ''Spyplane: The U-2 History Declassified'' Zenith Imprint, 14 Apr 2001 ISBN 0760309574 Retrieved 2012-06-28&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>(secondary) M Smith - [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lf2VQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=China+Hidden+Cloak+and+Dagger+History+of+MI5&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z6DsT-yYE8LO8QOSkqXCBQ&amp;redir_esc=y V.

This policy often takes of form of [[tariffs]] and restrictive [[Import quota|quotas]].  Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the [[great depression]] and the onset of World War II.  ===Religion=== Muslim teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest). By trade the whole society get benefits but interest makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.&lt;ref>[[#Nomani1994|Nomani &amp; Rahnema (1994)]], p.&amp;nbsp;?. "I want nine out of ten people from my Ummah (nation) as traders" and "Trader, who did trading in truth, and sold the right quantity and quality of goods, he will stand along Prophets and Martyrs, on Judgment day".&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities; but let there be among you traffic and trade by mutual good-will." {{cite quran|4|29|style=ref}} and "Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury." {{cite quran|2|275|style=ref}}&lt;/ref>  [[Judeo-Christian]] teachings encourage traders to avoid dishonest gain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  ===Development of money=== {{Main|History of money}} [[Image:SNGCop 039.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Athens|Ancient Athenian Greek]] [[Drachma]] coin]] [[Image:Maximinus denarius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[denarius]]]] The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called [[commodity money]] and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval [[Iraq]], bread was used as an early form of money.  In [[Mexico]] under [[Montezuma]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} cocoa beans were money.  [http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm]  [[Currency]] was introduced as a standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services.  This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.  [[Numismatist]]s have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].&lt;ref name="originsofmoney">Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in [[#Davies2002|Davies (2002)]].&lt;/ref>  Ancient Sparta minted [[coins]] from iron to discourage its citizens from engaging in foreign trade.  ==Current trends== ===Doha rounds=== {{Main|Doha round}}  The Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aims to lower [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] around the world, with a focus on making [[fair trade|trade fairer]] for [[developing countries]].  Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich [[developed countries]], represented by the [[G20]], and the major developing countries.  [[Agricultural subsidies]] are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on [[trade facilitation]] and capacity building.  The Doha round began in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], and negotiations have subsequently continued in: [[CancÃºn]], Mexico; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; and [[Paris]], [[France]] and Hong Kong.  ===China=== Beginning around 1978, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) began an experiment in [[economic reforms in China|economic reform]]. In contrast to the previous [[USSR|Soviet]]-style [[centrally planned economy]], the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, that led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) [[Special Economic Zone]]s located along the South-east coast.  The reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, [[price]] and [[demand]]. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.  In 1991 the PRC joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization. ''See also:'' [[Economy of the People's Republic of China]]  ==International trade== {{Main|International trade}} {{Trade bloc}}  International trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders.  In most countries, it represents a significant part of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, [[Amber Road]]), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of [[Industrialization]], advanced transportation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]]. In fact, it is probably the increasing prevalence of international trade that is usually meant by the term "globalization".  Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as [[South Korea]], which adopted a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]], and India, which historically had a more closed policy (although it has begun to open its economy, as of 2005).  South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.  ===Trade sanctions=== [[Trade sanctions]] against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action.  An [[embargo]], a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] against [[Cuba]] for over 40 years.  ===Trade barriers=== Although there are usually few trade restrictions within countries, international trade is usually regulated by governmental quotas and restrictions, and often taxed by tariffs.  Tariffs are usually on imports, but sometimes countries may impose export tariffs or [[subsidy|subsidies]].  All of these are called '''[[trade barriers]]'''.  If a government removes all trade barriers, a condition of free trade exists.  A government that implements a protectionist policy establishes trade barriers.  ===Fair trade=== The '''[[fair trade]]''' movement, also known as the '''trade justice''' movement, promotes the use of [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Social issues|social]] standards for the production of [[commodities]], particularly those exported from the [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]]s to the [[First World]]. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a [[human right]].&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Should trade be considered a human right?|date=9 December 2008|publisher=COPLA|url=http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523}}&lt;/ref>  Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of [[employment law|employment]] and [[commercial law]].  Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of [[good (economics)|goods]] made using [[slave labour]] to minimum [[price support]] schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.  [[Non-governmental organization]]s also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with [[fair trade labeling]] requirements.  ==Notes== {{Reflist}}  ==Bibliography== {{Portal|Economics}} {{Commons category|Trading|Trade}} * {{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I |authorlink=Christopher I.

The word "university" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''universitas magistrorum et scholarium'', which roughly means "community of teachers and [[academia|scholars]]."&lt;ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5vgGE8_CGOEC&amp;pg=PA748&amp;lpg=PA748&amp;dq=community+of+teachers+and+scholars+universitas+magistrorum+et+scholarium |title=Google eBook of '&amp;#39;'&amp;#39;'EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'&amp;#39;'&amp;#39;' |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref>  == History == [[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of a university lecture in the 1350s]]  === Definition === The original [[Latin]] word ''"universitas"'' refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc."&lt;ref>{{Citation | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Charlton T. | last2 = Short | first2 = Charles | title = A Latin Dictionary | place = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | origyear = 1879 | year = 1966 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref> At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.&lt;ref>Marcia L. Colish, ''Medieval Foundations of the Western Intellectual Tradition, 400-1400,'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1997), p. 267.&lt;/ref> The original Latin word referred to degree-granting institutions of learning in [[Western Europe]], where this form of legal organisation was prevalent, and from where the institution spread around the world. For non-related educational institutions of antiquity which did not stand in the tradition of the university and to which the term is only loosely and retrospectively applied, see [[ancient higher-learning institutions]].  ==== Academic freedom ==== An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of [[academic freedom]]. The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university. The [[University of Bologna]] adopted an academic charter, the ''[[Authentica habita|Constitutio Habit]]a'',&lt;ref>Malagola, C. (1888), Statuti delle UniversitÃ  e dei Collegi dello Studio Bolognese. Bologna: Zanichelli.&lt;/ref> in 1158 or 1155,&lt;ref name="RÃ¼egg, W. 2003 pp 4-34">RÃ¼egg, W.

Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".&lt;ref>Watson, P. (2005), Ideas. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 373&lt;/ref> This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 430 university rectors signed the ''[[Magna Charta Universitatum]]'',&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.unibo.it/avl/charta/charta.htm |title=Magna Charta delle UniversitÃ  Europee |publisher=.unibo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref> marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation.

The development of cathedral schools into universities actually appears to be quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception&amp;nbsp;â€” see Leff, ''Paris and Oxford Universities''), later they were also founded by Kings ([[University of Naples Federico II]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian University in KrakÃ³w]]) or municipal administrations ([[University of Cologne]], [[University of Erfurt]]). In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.&lt;ref>Johnson, P. (2000). The Renaissance : a short history.

(See [[Degrees of the University of Oxford]] for the history of how the trivium and quadrivium developed in relation to degrees, especially in [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] universities).  Universities became popular all over Europe, as rulers and city governments began to create them to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefit of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2.&lt;/ref>  The rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]'s works - more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated - fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history.&lt;ref>Rubenstein, R. E. (2003). Aristotle's children: how Christians, Muslims, and Jews rediscovered ancient wisdom and illuminated the dark ages (1st ed.). Orlando, Fla: Harcourt, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref> Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works â€œa turning point in the history of Western thought."&lt;ref>Dales, R. C. (1990). Medieval discussions of the eternity of the world (Vol. 18). Brill Archive, p. 144.&lt;/ref> After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this â€œ[[scholasticism]]â€? were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.  The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, [[disputation]]s and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, [[natural philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]]; while [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]] were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation â€“ in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2004). "The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation". Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 2-8.&lt;/ref> The structure of Northern Universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.&lt;ref>Scott, J. C. (2006).

At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref> This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) â€“ this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time.&lt;ref>Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref> It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term â€œuniversityâ€? was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In Mediterranean countries, the term ''[[studium generale]]'' was still often used, while â€œAcademyâ€? was common in Northern European countries.&lt;ref>Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 47.&lt;/ref> [[Image:Class at Salamanca.jpg|thumb|200px|17th century classroom at the [[University of Salamanca]]]] The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the seventeenth century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the [[Thirty Years' War]], disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, [[regicide]], and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, p. 23.&lt;/ref> This era was also affected by the rise of the [[nation-state]]. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.&lt;ref>Scott, J. C. (2006). The mission of the university: Medieval to Postmodern transformations. Journal of Higher Education, 77(1), pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref>  Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty â€œmasters,â€? provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching was centralized around a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at [[University of Oxford]] where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization.&lt;ref>Frijhoff, W. (1996). Patterns. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in early modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, p. 65.&lt;/ref>  Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: [[natural philosophy]], logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and [[rhetoric]]. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.&lt;ref>Ruegg, W. (1992). Epilogue: the rise of humanism. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in the Middle Ages, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref> Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the [[studia humanitatis]]. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 223.&lt;/ref> Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2002). The universities of the Italian renaissance. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 197.&lt;/ref> Professors of medicine such as [[NiccolÃ² Leoniceno]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, [[Andreas Vesalius]] was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the ''[[Corpus Juris]]'' with a humanist perspective, while [[Jacques Cujas]] humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] cited the works of [[Erasmus]] as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.&lt;ref>Ruegg, W. (1996). Themes. In H. D. Ridder-Symoens (Ed.), Universities in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1800, A history of the university in Europe. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, pp. 33-39.&lt;/ref> [[Galileo Galilei]], who taught at the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[University of Padua|Padua]], and [[Martin Luther]], who taught at the [[University of Wittenberg]] (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.&lt;ref>Grendler, P. F. (2004). The universities of the Renaissance and Reformation. Renaissance Quarterly, 57, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref>  Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and lead to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research.&lt;ref>Bylebyl, J. J. (2009). Disputation and description in the renaissance pulse controversy. In A. Wear, R. K. French, &amp; I. M. Lonie (Eds.), The medical renaissance of the sixteenth century (1st ed., pp. 223-245). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref> The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices.&lt;ref>FÃ¼ssel, S. (2005). Gutenberg and the Impact of Printing (English ed.). Aldershot, Hampshire: Ashgate Pub., p. 145.&lt;/ref>  Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution. Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university, the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution. Historians such as Richard Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.&lt;ref>Westfall, R. S. (1977). The construction of modern science: mechanisms and mechanics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 105.&lt;/ref> This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors, usually in princely courts, and associations with newly forming scientific societies.&lt;ref>Ornstein, M. (1928). The role of scientific societies in the seventeenth century. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref>  Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450-1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts.&lt;ref>Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref> It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.&lt;ref>Westman, R. S. (1975). The Melanchthon circle:, rheticus, and the Wittenberg interpretation of the Copernicantheory. Isis, 66(2), 164-193.&lt;/ref> Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.&lt;ref>Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 210-229.&lt;/ref> Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.&lt;ref>Gascoigne, J. (1990). A reappraisal of the role of the universities in the Scientific Revolution. In D. C. Lindberg &amp; R. S. Westman (Eds.), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, pp. 245-248.&lt;/ref>  Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a â€œgeneral scholarâ€? immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge.&lt;ref>Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy.

There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.&lt;ref>Feingold, M. (1991). Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period. In P. Barker &amp; R. Ariew (Eds.), Revolution and continuity: essays in the history and philosophy of early modern science, Studies in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref> Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions, they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors.&lt;ref>see, for instance, Baldwin, M. (1995). The snakestone experiments: an early modern medical debate. Isis, 86(3), 394-418.&lt;/ref>  By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.  === Modern universities === {{Main|History of European research universities|List of modern universities in Europe (1801â€“1945)}} [[File:Coimbra University Tower 2.jpg|thumb|The tower of the [[University of Coimbra]], the oldest [[Portugal|Portuguese]] university]] [[File:Uni KA Portal.jpg|thumb|[[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], a German technical university, founded in the 19th century]] By the 18th century, universities published their own [[academic journal|research journals]] and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]â€™s liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of [[academic freedom|freedom]], [[seminar]]s, and [[laboratory|laboratories]] in universities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.  Until the 19th century, [[religion]] played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses. In Britain, the move from [[Industrial Revolution]] to [[modernity]] saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on [[science]] and [[engineering]], a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray (chairman of the University Grants Committee) and [[Samuel Curran|Sir Samuel Curran]], with the formation of the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref> The British also established universities worldwide, and [[higher education]] became available to the masses not only in Europe.  In 1963, the [[Robbins Report]] on universities in the [[United Kingdom]] concluded that such institutions should have four main "objectives essential to any properly balanced system: instruction in skills; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women; to maintain research in balance with teaching, since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html|title=The 'Idea of a University' today|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=March 2010|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref>  === National universities === A [[national university]] is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national [[cultural]] or [[political]] aspirations, for instance the [[National University of Ireland]] in the early days of [[Irish Free State|Irish independence]] collected a large amount of information on the [[Irish language]] and [[Irish culture]]. Reforms in Argentina were the result of the [[University Revolution]] of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system.  === Intergovernmental universities === Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaty between states are [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]]. Such as [[Academy of European Law]] offering training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (PÃ´le Universitaire Euclide, Euclid University)]] is chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States. The [[European University Institute]], a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organisation, set up by the member states of the [[European Union]].  == Organization == [[File:University of Sydney Main Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Sydney]] is [[Australia]]'s oldest university.]] Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president, [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], or [[Rector (academia)|rector]]; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. [[Public university]] systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards. They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] autonomy. [[private university|Private universities]] are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.  == Universities around the world == {{See also|List of universities and colleges by country}} [[File:Aerial view uog1.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Gujrat]] in [[Gujrat]], [[Pakistan]]]] The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|title=Basic Classification Technical Details|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref>{{-}}  == Classification ==  The definition of a university varies widely even within some countries. For example, there is no nationally standardized definition of the term in the United States although the term has traditionally been used to designate [[research institution]]s and was once reserved for research doctorate-granting institutions.&lt;ref>[http://educationusa.ecacms.getusinfo.com/home/education-usa/global-left-nav/graduate-study/about-graduate-education-in-the-u/types-of-institutions US Department of State: Types of Graduate schools]&lt;/ref> Some states, such as [[Massachusetts]], will only grant a school "university status" if it grants at least two [[doctoral degree]]s.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.edu/forinstitutions/academic/documents/610CMR.pdf |title=Massachusetts Board of Education: Degree-granting regulations for independent institutions of higher education |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] is responsible for approving the use of the word "university" in the title of an institution, under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy">{{Cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=2007-12-06 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090223084511/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |archivedate= 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref> In India, a new tag [[deemed universities]] has been created for high performing universities, giving them additional autonomy. Through this provision many universities sprung up in India, which are commercial in nature and have been established just to exploit the demand of higher education.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|author=&amp;mdash; Peter Drucker |url=http://learnhub.com/news/1254- |title=â€˜Deemedâ€™ status distributed freely during Arjun Singhâ€™s tenure - LearnHub News |publisher=Learnhub.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref>  == Colloquial usage == Colloquially, the term ''university'' may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland, ''college'' is often used instead: "When I was in college..."; see the [[College#British and American usage contrasted|college]] article for further discussion). In Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands and the [[German-speaking countries]] ''university'' is often contracted to ''uni''.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  == Cost == {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}} {{Globalize |Section |date=October 2012 }} {{Main|Tuition payments}} Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2012, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States is $23,300 USD.&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Grading Student Loans|url=http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/03/grading-student-loans.html|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref>   In many countries, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased national or state funding given to public universities.&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Students at Public Universities, Colleges Will Bear the Burden of Reduced Funding for Higher Education|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref>  There are some big exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in [[Nordic countries]] were entirely without tuition fees until the latter part of the 2000. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. But still, citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland are exempted from tuitions fees and the amount of public grants granted to promising foreign students was increased to offset some of the impact.&lt;ref>[http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf "Studieavgifter i hÃ¶gskolan"] [[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2006:7 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref>  == See also == {{Portal|University}} {{Commons|Universities}} {{wikiquote|Universities}} {{wikiversity}} &lt;div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"> * [[Alternative university]] * [[Ancient higher-learning institutions]] * [[Catholic University]] * [[College and university rankings]] * [[Corporate university]] * [[International university]] ** [[G.
