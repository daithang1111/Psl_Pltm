A '''mathematician''' is a [[person]] with an extensive [[knowledge]] of [[mathematics]] who uses this knowledge in their work, typically to solve [[mathematical problem]]s. Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[collection]], [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]], and [[Calculus|change]]. 

Mathematicians involved with solving problems outside of pure mathematics are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]]. 

The discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.

==Education==
Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students who pass are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].

==Motivation==
Mathematicians do research in fields such as [[logic]], [[set theory]], [[category theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[number theory]], [[analysis]], [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[dynamical systems]], [[combinatorics]], [[game theory]], [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[computation]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. These fields comprise both [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]] and establish links between the two. Some fields, such as the theory of dynamical systems, or game theory, are classified as applied mathematics due to the relationships they possess with physics, economics and the other sciences. Whether probability theory and statistics are of theoretical nature, applied nature, or both, is quite controversial among mathematicians. Other branches of mathematics, however, such as logic, number theory, category theory or set theory are accepted as part of pure mathematics, though they find application in other sciences (predominantly [[computer science]] and [[physics]]). Likewise, analysis, geometry and topology, although considered pure mathematics, find applications in theoretical physicsâ€”[[string theory]], for instance.

Though it is true that mathematics finds diverse applications in many areas of research, a mathematician does not determine the value of an idea by the diversity of its applications. Mathematics is interesting in its own right, and a substantial minority of mathematicians investigate the diversity of structures studied in ''mathematics itself''. However, among academic mathematics, the majority of mathematical papers published in the United States are written by academics outside of mathematics departments. 

Furthermore, a mathematician is not someone who merely manipulates formulas, numbers or equationsâ€”the diversity of mathematics allows for research concerning how concepts in one area of mathematics can be used in other areas too. For instance, if one graphs a set of solutions of an equation in some higher dimensional space, he may ask about the geometric properties of the graph. Thus one can understand equations by a pure understanding of abstract [[topology]] or [[geometry]]â€”this idea is of importance in [[algebraic geometry]]. Similarly, a mathematician does not restrict his study of numbers to the [[integer]]s; rather he considers more abstract structures such as [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], and in particular [[number ring]]s in the context of [[algebraic number theory]]. This exemplifies the abstract nature of mathematics and how it is not restricted to questions one may ask in daily life.

In a different direction, mathematicians ask questions about space and transformations that are not restricted to geometric figures such as squares and circles. For instance, an active area of research in [[differential topology]] concerns itself with the ways one can "smooth" higher dimensional figures. In fact, whether one can smooth certain higher dimensional spheres was, until recently, an open problem â€” known as the smooth [[PoincarÃ© conjecture]]. Another aspect of mathematics, [[set-theoretic topology]] and [[point-set topology]], concerns objects of a different nature from objects in our universe, or in a higher dimensional analogue of our universe. These objects behave in a rather strange manner under deformations, and the properties they possess are completely different from those of objects in our universe. For instance, the "distance" between two points on such an object, may depend on the order in which you consider the pair of points. This is quite different from ordinary life, in which it is accepted that the straight line distance from person A to person B is the same as that between person B and person A.

Another aspect of mathematics, often referred to as "foundational mathematics", consists of the fields of [[logic]] and [[set theory]]. These explore various ideas regarding the ways one can prove certain claims. This theory is far more complex than it seems, in that the truth of a claim depends on the context in which the claim is made, unlike basic ideas in daily life where truth is absolute. In fact, although some claims may be true, it is impossible to prove or disprove them in rather natural contexts.

Category theory, another field within "foundational mathematics", is rooted on the abstract axiomatization of the definition of a "class of mathematical structures", referred to as a "category". A category intuitively consists of a collection of objects, and defined relationships between them. While these objects may be anything (such as "tables" or "chairs"), mathematicians are usually interested in particular, more abstract, classes of such objects. In any case, it is the ''relationships between these objects'', and ''not the actual objects'' that are predominantly studied.

== Differences with scientists ==
Mathematics differs from [[natural science]] in that scientists subject [[truth claim]]s to tests by experiments, while mathematical [[proposition]]s are conclusions of [[mathematical proof]]s. 

If a definite statement is believed plausible by some mathematicians but has been neither proved nor disproved, it is called a ''[[conjecture]]'', as opposed to an ultimate goal: a ''theorem'' that has been proved. 

Scientific theories change when new information about the world is discovered. Mathematics changes in a similar way: New ideas do not falsify old ones, but new concepts refine old concepts and old theories, attaining a fuller understanding of the truth.  One method of refinement is [[generalization]], for example widening the scope of a concept. For instance, [[calculus]] (in one variable) generalizes to [[multivariable calculus]], which generalizes to analysis on [[manifold]]s. The development of [[algebraic geometry]] from its classical to modern forms is a particularly striking example of the way an area of mathematics can change radically in its viewpoint, without making what was correctly proved before in any way incorrect; of course mathematical progress clarifies gaps in previous proofs, often by exposing hidden assumptions, which progress has revealed worth conceptualizing. 

A theorem is true, and was true before we knew it and will be true after humans are extinct. Of course, our understanding of what the theorem ''really means'' gains in profundity as the mathematics around the theorem grows. A mathematician feels that a theorem is better understood when it can be extended to apply in a broader setting than previously known. For instance, [[Fermat's little theorem]] for the nonzero integers modulo a prime generalizes to [[Euler's theorem]] for the invertible numbers modulo any nonzero integer, which generalizes to [[Lagrange theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] for finite groups.

== Women in mathematics ==
{{See also|List of female mathematicians}}

While the majority of mathematicians are male, there have been some demographic changes since [[World War II]]. Some prominent female mathematicians are [[Hypatia of Alexandria]] (ca. 400 AD), [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815â€“1852), [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]] (1718â€“1799), [[Emmy Noether]] (1882â€“1935), [[Sophie Germain]] (1776â€“1831), [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] (1850â€“1891), [[Alicia Boole Stott]] (1860â€“1940), [[RÃ³zsa PÃ©ter]] (1905â€“1977), [[Julia Robinson]] (1919â€“1985), [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] (1906â€“1995), [[Ã‰milie du ChÃ¢telet]] (1706â€“1749), [[Mary Cartwright]] (1900â€“1998), [[Olga Aleksandrovna Ladyzhenskaya|Olga Ladyzhenskaya]] (1922â€“2004), and [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik|Olga Oleinik]] (1925â€“2001).

The [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] is a professional society whose purpose is "to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences."
The [[American Mathematical Society]] and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics.

== Prizes in mathematics ==
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though sometimes mathematicians have won the Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the [[Abel Prize]], the [[Chern Medal]], the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Gauss Prize]], the [[Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[Crafoord Prize]],  the [[Shaw Prize]], the [[Steele Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[Schock Prize]], and the [[Nevanlinna Prize]].

The following are quotations about mathematicians, or by mathematicians.

: ''A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.''
::â€”Attributed to both [[AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi]]&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html |title=Biography of AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref> and [[Paul ErdÅ‘s]]

: ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so Ã¼bersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.'' (Mathematicians are [like] a sort of Frenchmen; if you talk to them, they translate it into their own language, and then it is immediately something quite different.)
::â€”[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]

: ''Each generation has its few great mathematicians...and [the others'] research harms no one.''
::â€”[[Alfred W. Adler]] (1930- ), "Mathematics and Creativity"&lt;ref>Alfred Adler, "Mathematics and Creativity," ''The New Yorker'', 1972, reprinted in Timothy Ferris, ed., ''The World Treasury of Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics'', Back Bay Books, reprint, June 30, 1993, p, 435.&lt;/ref>

: ''In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.''
::â€”[[Edgar Allan Poe]], ''The purloined letter''

: ''A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.''
::â€”[[G. H. Hardy]], ''A Mathematician's Apology''

: ''Some of you may have met mathematicians and wondered how they got that way.''
::â€”[[Tom Lehrer]]

: ''It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.''
::â€”[[Sofia Kovalevskaya]]

: ''There are two ways to do great mathematics. The first is to be smarter than everybody else. The second way is to be stupider than everybody elseâ€”but persistent.''
::â€”[[Raoul Bott]]
